Carrot And Courgette Laksa. Curries are great for packing in nutrient-rich vegetables. Carrots are a rich and widely available source of beta-carotene, but you could easily use grated sweet potato or butternut squash for similar nutrient and health properties. Serves: 4 (with leftovers) Prep time: 10 minutes Cook time: 10 minutes Ingredients: 600ml water 1 vegetable stock cube 1 tbsp shop-bought Malaysian Laksa Paste (or any other south-east Asian paste that you fancy) 400ml tin coconut milk 200g brown rice noodles 200g carrots, grated 300g courgettes, grated 200g green beans, roughly chopped ½ red chilli, finely chopped A little chopped fresh coriander, to serve ½ red apple 1 lime, halved Method: Bring the water to the boil in a large saucepan and dissolve the stock cube in the water. Add the laksa paste and coconut milk and bring to a simmer. Add the noodles and stir for 2–3 minutes then add all the vegetables. Bring to a simmer and allow the flavours to marry for a few minutes before dividing among large bowls. Scatter the chilli over each serving along with a little chopped coriander. Grate some apple over each serving and finish with a squeeze of fresh lime juice. Mix it up: + Swap the brown rice noodles for white rice noodles or other noodles you have on hand (bearing in mind that they might take less or more time to cook). + Try grating other vegetables like celeriac, parsnip or even beetroot for a delicious earthy twist.
