Chickpea, carrot and red pepper curry. I like to call this ‘my little bowl of sunshine’ because it’s jam-packed with vibrant colours from the carrots, peppers, tomatoes and spices. It’s packed full of nutrients and it’s high in fibre. Serves 4 Ingredients: 1 tbsp coconut oil 1 onion, finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, grated 1 tsp garam masala 1 tsp ground turmeric 1 tsp ground cumin ¼ tsp chilli powder, or more according to preference ¼ tsp salt 1 tbsp tomato purée 1 x 400g tin of tomatoes 2 carrots, peeled and chopped 1 bell pepper (yellow, orange or red), deseeded and sliced 1 x 400ml tin of reduced-fat coconut milk 1 x 400g tin of chickpeas, drained and rinsed To serve (optional) Brown rice 1 large roasted sweet potato, to stuff with the curry (how I like it) Method: Heat the oil in a large saucepan and add the onion. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, spices, salt and tomato purée and stir to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes. Tip in the tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the carrots and pepper, then pour in the coconut milk and bring to the boil. Simmer for 15 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and the carrots have softened but still have a bite to them. Add the chickpeas and warm through for a further five minutes. Eat immediately, served with rice or stuffed into a baked sweet potato. Alternatively, store in an airtight container in the fridge for last-minute dinners after work.
