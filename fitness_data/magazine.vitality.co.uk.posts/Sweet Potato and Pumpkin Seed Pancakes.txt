Sweet Potato and Pumpkin Seed Pancakes. Sweet potato has a lower glycaemic load than regular white potato, it’s higher in fibre and is better for B Vitamins, which support your energy production, female hormone balance, heart health and mood. They are also rich in beta-carotene, which is very good for eye health. To make it sweet, the recipe contains honey. Although effectively a form of pure sugar, honey is a naturally occuring variety that, when compared to refined white sugar, has small benefits in terms of vitamins and minerals. If trying to give up sugar, you need to retrain your taste buds and reduce the habit of having sweet things all of the time. Makes 6 Ingredients: 100g sweet potato 100ml almond milk 100g brown rice flour 1 tbsp. honey 1/2 tsp. mixed spice 25g pumpkin seeds Coconut oil, for greasing Method: Peel the sweet potato, discard the skin and chop the rest of the potato into small pieces. Steam or boil the sweet potato chunks for about 10 minutes, until they’re really soft. Place the potato in a blender with the almond milk, flour, honey and mixed spice, and blend for 30 seconds or so, until the mixture is totally smooth. Place a non-stick frying pan on the stove and grease it with coconut oil, then allow it to get really hot before placing about two tablespoons worth of batter in it. Use a spoon to shape the batter into a circle, then allow it to cook for a minute before sprinkling over the pumpkin seeds. Cook for a further two minutes, until the top of it is starting to firm. Flip and allow to cook on the other side. Continue until you’ve used up all the batter. Top tip: make sure that you cook the first side for long enough else they won’t flip properly. Serve topped with Greek yoghurt and orange zest. Drizzle with a touch more honey if you’re feeling indulgent. Delicious!
