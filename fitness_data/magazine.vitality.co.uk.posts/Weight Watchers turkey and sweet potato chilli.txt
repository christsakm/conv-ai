Add the turkey, season, then cook over a high heat for 5­-6 minutes, breaking the mince up with a wooden spoon, until there is no pink meat left. Tip on to a plate and set aside. 2 Mist the pan with spray and add the onion, garlic, sweet potato and a splash of water. Cook over a medium-high heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding more water to prevent sticking until the vegetables are tender. 3 Stir through the chilli powder, beans and tomatoes. Fill the empty bean tin with water and pour into the pan. Return the cooked mince to the pan, stir to combine, and simmer for 15­-20 minutes. 4 Stir in the spinach to wilt and serve seasoned with black pepper. TIP Freeze in individual portions for up to 1 month – defrost overnight in the fridge before reheating until piping hot throughout. Recipes courtesy of Weight Watchers magazine.
