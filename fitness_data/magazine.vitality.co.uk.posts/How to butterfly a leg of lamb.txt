How to butterfly a leg of lamb. This month, top chef and food writer Myles Williamson is giving us his brilliant BBQ recipes and tips. Check out his recipe for this luscious butterflied lamb with BBQ roast potatoes and grilled lettuce. 1. Place the lamb leg, meatier-side down on a chopping board. Use your finger to locate the leg and shin bones and using a small sharp knife, slice along the length of the bones, staying as close as possible. 2. Using short sharp strokes, work your way around the bones and then cut out the knuckle connecting them, trying not to slice through the skin; don’t worry too much if you do cut through the flesh and it’s a bit patchy in places. Place the bones in a sandwich bag and freeze for up 1 month, to use in stocks. 3. Cut off any excessive fat or sinew, as well as any small, loose pieces of flesh (you can ask your butcher to mince the offcuts for kebabs or burgers). Lay the joint out and slice horizontally through any thicker parts without cutting the whole way through, to make the whole piece an even thickness. 4. You should now have one whole, flat, butterflied joint ready to marinade or throw straight onto the grill; cut it in half if you find it easier to handle, though keep an eye on it when grilling, as this may shorten the cooking time.
