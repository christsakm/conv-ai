Blueberry Swirl Protein Pancakes. These pancakes are made with oats, which are a soluble fibre that help to keep you full by releasing energy slowly. They also contain chia seeds, cottage cheese and egg whites to make the pancakes a bit more substantial and increase the protein content. By only using the egg whites you get the texture without the fat and calories found in the egg’s yolk. The blueberries can be fresh or frozen. Serves 2 Ingredients: 80g oats 40g chia seeds 120g cottage cheese 4 egg whites 1 tsp vanilla extract 100g blueberries 1 tsp cinnamon Fresh blueberries for garnish (optional) Coconut oil for frying Tip: you can use frozen blueberries as they’re generally cheaper and just as nutritious! Method: Blend all ingredients except the blueberries in a blender Roughly stir through the defrosted blueberries to make a swirl pattern in the mixture Place a non-stick frying pan on the stove and grease it with coconut oil, then allow it to get really hot before placing about two tablespoons’ worth of batter in it. Use a spoon to shape the batter into a circle, allow it to cook for two – three minutes, until the top of it is starting to firm. Flip and allow cooking on the other side. Continue until you’ve used up all the batter. Serve topped with Greek yoghurt, fresh blueberries, coconut flakes and a little maple syrup if you have a sweet tooth.
