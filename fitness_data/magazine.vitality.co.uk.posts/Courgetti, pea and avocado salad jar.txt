Alternatively, a Julienne peeler does the trick. You can pull this lunch together in the morning, and just add the avocado when you’re ready to eat. If you want to prep the avocado at home, add it last and squeeze more lemon juice over to help stop any browning. Serves 1 Ingredients: 1 tbsp olive oil Zest of ½ lemon, and a squeeze of lemon juice Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 50g frozen petits pois 1 courgette 1 handful mint leaves 1 handful pea shoots 1 tbsp pumpkin seeds 1 ripe avocado Method: Put the oil in a large sealable jar or lidded pot, then add the lemon zest and juice. Add salt and plenty of pepper. Tip in the frozen petits pois. Spiralize the courgette straight into the jar. Tear the mint leaves, and add to the jar with the pea shoots and pumpkin seeds. Seal the jar. Pack the avocado to take with you. The peas will have defrosted by lunchtime. Time to eat… Tip the sealed jar to allow the dressing to coat the salad. Cut open the avocado, discard the pit and scoop out chunks with a spoon on to your salad.
