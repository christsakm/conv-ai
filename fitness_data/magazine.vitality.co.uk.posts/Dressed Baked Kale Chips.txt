Dressed Baked Kale Chips. No drinks reception is complete without a bowl of crisps and nuts. Reduce the salt and fat contents by switching out the shop-bought variety and instead try baking vegetables such as beetroot, sweet potato, kale, or soybeans and pumpkin seeds instead of salted peanuts. Sprinkle over a classic combination of sea salt and cracked pepper, or some chilli flakes and a squeeze of lime for a fiery kick this festive season. These alternatives are also packed full of vitamins and minerals, such as the vitamin E found in pumpkin seeds, which will help with dry skin in the cold weather. Ingredients Approx. 1/2 bag kale leaves 1/2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast (or marmite) 1 teaspoon garlic powder 3/4 teaspoon chili powder 1/2 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika 1/4 teaspoon pink Himalayan sea salt 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional) Method Preheat oven to 150C. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove leaves from the stems of the kale and roughly tear it up into large pieces.). Wash the leaves and pat with kitchen towel until thoroughly dry. Add kale leaves into a large bowl. Massage in the oil until all the nooks and crannies are coated in oil. Now sprinkle on the spices/seasonings and toss to combine. Spread out the kale onto the prepared baking sheet into a single layer, being sure not to overcrowd the kale. Bake for 10 minutes, rotate the pan, and bake for another 12-15 minutes more until the kale begins to firm up. The kale will look shrunken, but this is normal. I bake for 25 mins. total in my oven. Cool the kale on the sheet for 3 minutes before digging in! This really makes all the difference! Enjoy immediately as they lose their crispiness with time.
