Vegetable Samosa Tart. Everyone loves a vegetable samosa, but they’re not quite suitable as a standalone main course. Instead, try a Vegetable Samosa Tart with a filo pastry base and delicious veg. Makes one portion (multiply ingredients for extra servings). Ingredients: 2 sheets of filo pastry ¼ red onion, sliced ½ carrot, sliced A few broccoli florets Handful of frozen peas 2 tsp curry powder Olive oil Salt and pepper Method: Preheat your oven to 190°C/gas mark 5. Brush the sheets of filo pastry with olive oil on both sides and use them to line a small ovenproof dish to create a pie base, scrunching up the edges. Throw in the veg (make sure you cut them thin enough to cook all the way through) then drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle in the curry powder and season with salt and pepper. Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, until the filo is golden brown and the vegetables are cooked. Recipes extracted from Miguel Barclay’s Super Easy One Pound Meals (£16.99, Headline).
