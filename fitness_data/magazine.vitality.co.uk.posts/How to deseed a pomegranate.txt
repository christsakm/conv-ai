How to deseed a pomegranate. This month, top chef and food writer Myles Williamson is giving us his brilliant BBQ recipes and tips.

Slice through the equator of the pomegranate and hold cut-side down, set between your fingers in one hand, over a large bowl.

Repeat with the other half and discard any pieces of white pith from the bowl.
