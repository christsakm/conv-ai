Day 8: Ellie Simmonds’ Banana Pancakes | Vitality At Home. Published: 10 April 2020 Hands up, who loves pancakes? Team GB Paralympian Ellie Simmonds certainly does and has given us her delicious, healthy banana pancakes recipe. Perfect for weekend breakfasts – and with a few twists can be made naughty or nice. Prep time: 5 minutes Cook time: 5 minutes Total time: 10 minutes Serves: 2 Ingredients 1 x banana 1 x egg Scoop of flour ½ tsp of baking powder Splash of milk Honey, fruit and yogurt for serving Method Mash up your banana in a bowl, crack in your egg and add your flour, baking powder and milk. Stir it all together until the mixture forms the consistency of smooth, thin paste. Add a dollop of coconut oil to your frying pan and get it nice and hot. Add in two big spoonfuls of your mixture and fry off until golden brown, flipping the pancakes to ensure they’re evenly cooked. Once cooked, stack your pancakes on top of each other and get ready for the fun bit – adding your toppings. Ellie’s opted to keep her pancakes healthy with fruit, yogurt and a squeeze of honey, but you can add whatever you like to yours – chocolate, cinnamon or syrup.
