Butterbean, chicory and avocado salad. This salad is perfect as a light supper. Avocados contain magnesium, potassium and vitamin B6, which all help to induce sleep. Serves: 4 Prep: 15 minutes Ingredients: 3 heads white or red chicory 2 red apples 1 bunch spring onions, finely chopped 1 ripe avocado, stoned, peeled and sliced 1 x 400g can butterbeans, rinsed and drained 120g Roquefort cheese, diced or crumbled 60g chopped walnuts 1 small bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped For the honey mustard vinaigrette: 4 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp cider vinegar 2 tsp honey mustard Juice of 1 lemon Salt and freshly ground black pepper Method: Trim the fat bases off the chicory and thinly slice the heads into rounds. Core the apples and cut them into small cubes. Mix the chicory, apples, spring onions, avocado, butterbeans, Roquefort, walnuts and parsley in a bowl. Make the honey mustard vinaigrette: blend the oil and vinegar with the honey mustard and lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the chicory salad and toss gently together. Serve immediately. Or you can try this: Use diced or sliced pears instead of apples, or even stoned lychees. Vary the beans: try kidney beans, flageolets or even some blanched crunchy fine green beans. Make this salad more substantial by serving it with chicken.
