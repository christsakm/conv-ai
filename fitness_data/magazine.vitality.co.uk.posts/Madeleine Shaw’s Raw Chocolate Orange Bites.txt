Madeleine Shaw’s Raw Chocolate Orange Bites. These delicious chocolate orange nibbles are made with cacao butter and raw cacao powder – a good source of energy-boosting magnesium. They’re made even more delicious with zesty orange and a pinch of salt. Makes: 12 Cook time: 15 minutes Ingredients: 90g cacao butter 60g raw cacao powder 60g honey or maple syrup 1 large orange 1 pinch of sea salt Method: Melt the cacao butter on a low heat. Slowly sift in the cacao powder, then stir in the honey and salt. Mix well, then pour into moulds. Pour in enough chocolate to cover the bottom, keeping it 1mm thick (like an After Eight). Keep pouring into your moulds, then zest over the orange. Place in the freezer for an hour, then pop in the fridge until you’re ready to dig in. Recipe from madeleineshaw.com .
