Easy Peanut Butter And Apple Pizzas. These apple pizzas are so simple – they’re apple slices topped with peanut butter. Think of it as more of an activity, perfect for getting children involved and encouraging them to experiment with new flavours and textures. Recipe extracted from Get Your Kids to Eat Anything: The 5-Phase Programme by Emily Leary (Octopus Books, £16.99). Prep Time: 10 minutes Ingredients 2 tablespoons peanut butter 2 apples, cored and cut into 5mm slices Handful of raspberries, halved 2 bananas, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons runny honey 2 tablespoons mixed nuts, seeds or raisins, as desired Method Spread a little peanut butter onto one side of each apple ring. Arrange them on a platter or board. Set out the topping ingredients in small bowls on the table. Allow everyone to top their own apple pizzas, encouraging them to make patterns and faces while experimenting with ingredients they’ve never tried before. Top Tip: If the self-topping approach proves to be a hit, try introducing ‘topping stations’ to other mealtimes. A selection of fruit with your morning porridge, perhaps?
