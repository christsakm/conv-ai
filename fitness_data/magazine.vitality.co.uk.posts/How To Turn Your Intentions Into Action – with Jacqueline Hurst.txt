How To Turn Your Intentions Into Action – with Jacqueline Hurst. For many of us, 2020 has prompted us to think about how we live our lives and what’s important to us. But even if we know what we want to change in our lives, making that change can feel like an overwhelming prospect. To help you create long-term, healthy habits that will enable you to create a life you love and protect what matters to you the most, check out qualified hypnotherapist, NLP practitioner and master certified life coach Jacqueline Hurst ’s top tips on how to bring about positive change in your life. 1. Curate a strong mindset Encouraging and enabling positive and structured thoughts will really help you to achieve your goals. If you think you can, you will. Write down uplifting and motivational thoughts that will help you to achieve your goals and put them somewhere visible – stick them on the fridge or as your phone wallpaper so you can see them. Make sure what you write is something strong and positive – if you can see it, it starts to help your brain. 2. Tell someone what you’re looking to change about your life Telling someone about the change you want to make will make you accountable, and this will help you to make it happen. 3. Shut your eyes, sit down and visualize and feel how you’ll look and feel once you’ve completed this positive change Think about how you will feel at the end of this life change, and the confidence you’ll have when you’ve achieved something amazing. If you do this once a day it will really help you, as visualizing yourself at the end goal of what you want to achieve is a powerful tool to help you get there.
