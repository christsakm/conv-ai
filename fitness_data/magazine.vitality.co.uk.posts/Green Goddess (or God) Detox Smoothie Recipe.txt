Green Goddess (or God) Detox Smoothie Recipe. There’s a big buzz around green smoothies at the moment, and it’s for all the right reasons. The “Green Goddess” contains broccoli, spinach and celery, which are all full of sulphur compounds. These are known to speed up a process in our liver’s detoxification, making them really good at getting rid of excess toxins from the body – which may be ideal after the festive binge! They also help reduce that bloated feeling by supporting and cleansing the digestive system too. Ingredients: 25g broccoli 25g mango 25g pineapple 25g banana 25g spinach 25g celery 200ml apple juice or coconut water Method: Blitz the broccoli, mango, pineapple, banana, spinach and celery in a blender or smoothie maker. These can be fresh or frozen. Once blended, add 200ml of apple juice or coconut water. Tip: If using fresh fruit and vegetables, add a few ices cubes to your blender so your smoothie comes out chilled.
