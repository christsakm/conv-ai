Courgette Feta Fritters. The courgette actually forms the main base of the pancake, which helps to reduce the calorie intake and increases the Vitamin C too. Feta is a sheep’s milk cheese, and is therefore a bit lower in lactose and sometimes easier on digestion for people. The traditional pancake’s flour has also been swapped for the quinoa-variety, which is gluten free and rich in magnesium and zinc –  good for skin, energy levels and the immune system. The recipe mentions Himalayan pink sea salt, which is generally more beneficial than regular salt because of its lower sodium levels and other positive minerals. Makes 6 Ingredients: 2 medium courgettes (around 350g) 2 springs onions, thinly sliced 30g quinoa flour 60g feta, crumbled 2 eggs Himalayan pink sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste Rapeseed Oil for frying Method: Grate courgette with a medium sized grater Add salt and place shredded courgette in a clean dishtowel and squeeze to get as much liquid out of it as possible. (Do try to get as much out as you can!) Once squeezed place back in bowl and add beaten eggs, thinly sliced spring onions, quinoa flour and fresh ground black pepper and mix thoroughly. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat until pan is sizzling hot. Add spoonfuls of the mixture to the hot oil and cook for one minute. Sprinkle over the crumbled feta and cook for a further 2 minutes, flip and cook on the other side until golden brown. Place on paper towels to soak up any grease that sticks to the fritter Serve with a squeeze of lemon juice and some homemade mint yoghurt dip
