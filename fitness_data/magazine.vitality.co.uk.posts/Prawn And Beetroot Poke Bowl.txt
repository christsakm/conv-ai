Prawn And Beetroot Poke Bowl. Poke bowls are quickly gaining popularity and might just become the next big food fad, but they are so expensive to buy ready made. Here’s a budget DIY alternative with beetroot instead of tuna and shelled frozen broad beans instead of mega-expensive edamame beans. Makes one portion (multiply ingredients for extra servings). Ingredients: ½ mug of basmati rice 1 mug of water 1 tbsp balsamic glaze 1 tbsp sesame oil 1 tbsp soy sauce Small handful of cooked and peeled prawns ½ carrot, ribboned with a potato peeler 1 cooked beetroot, cut into 1cm cube Small handful of broad beans, defrosted and shelled Pinch of sesame seeds Method: Put the rice and water in a saucepan and cook over a medium heat with the lid on for about 7 minutes. When all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked, remove the lid and allow it to cool before spooning it into a bowl. Mix the balsamic glaze, sesame oil and soy sauce together and coat the prawns in the mixture, then spoon them onto the rice. Place the carrot ribbons, beetroot cubes and shelled broad beans neatly into the bowl. Sprinkle the sesame seeds over the prawns and drizzle over any remaining balsamic, sesame oil and soy glaze.
