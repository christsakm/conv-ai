Miso salmon, black rice and Asian greens. Miso is created with fermented soya beans, rice or grain and salt, and is packed with gut-loving bacteria. It adds the most amazing, intense flavour to salmon and it’s something I always have in my fridge. You can find miso in the Japanese section of most large supermarkets. Serves 2 Ingredients: 2 tbsp white miso paste 2 tsp soy sauce 1 tbsp maple syrup 2 salmon fillets 125g black rice 250ml water 1 tbsp sesame seed oil, plus extra to drizzle 1 garlic clove, chopped 1 head of pak choi, quartered lengthways 2 handfuls of spinach 1 tbsp sesame seeds Salt Method: Combine the miso paste, soy sauce and maple syrup in a bowl. Coat the salmon fillets in the mixture, then cover with cling film and marinate in the fridge overnight, or for at least two hours. Put the rice in a saucepan with the water and a pinch of salt. Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer for 40–45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain. While the rice is cooking, preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6. Line a roasting tray with tinfoil. Place the salmon in the prepared tray and roast for 15 minutes, until the flesh flakes easily and is cooked through. Place a wok or frying pan on a medium-high heat. Add the tablespoon of sesame oil and fry the garlic for 30 seconds, or until just beginning to sizzle. Add the pak choi and 1 tablespoon of water and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes. Add the spinach and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, until just wilted. Serve the greens with the salmon, adding a drizzle of sesame oil and a sprinkling of sesame seeds.
