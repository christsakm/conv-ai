Baked Rainbow Chard With Apricot And Walnuts. Rainbow chard is packed with vitamin K and magnesium, which are both essential for bone health, as well as antioxidant-rich phytochemicals like betalain. This dish combines the sweet flavour of stone fruit and chard’s bitter compounds perfectly. Serves: 2 Prep time: 5 minutes Cook time: 20 minutes Ingredients: 40g walnuts, whole or halved 1 red onion, halved and thinly sliced 200g Swiss chard, roughly sliced into 2cm-thick strips, stem included 1 fresh apricot, stoned and sliced into thin segments 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Method: Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Toss all the ingredients into a large roasting dish with plenty of salt and pepper. Bake in the oven for 18–20 minutes until the chard has slightly crisped up, then remove from the oven and serve with a drizzle of extra oil if needed. Mix it up: + I enjoy this with poached eggs for breakfast, but it works equally well with pan-fried or poached white fish like bream or sea bass.
