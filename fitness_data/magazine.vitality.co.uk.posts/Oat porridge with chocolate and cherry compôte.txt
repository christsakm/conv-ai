Oat porridge with chocolate and cherry compôte. Oats are comforting and rich in potassium, magnesium, calcium and tryptophan, all of which add up to good quality sleep. Because they’re low GI (glycaemic index) they release energy slowly to keep you sleeping soundly throughout the night. Serves: 2 Prep: 5 minutes Cook: 15-20 minutes Ingredients: 85g porridge oats A pinch of salt 200ml milk (or almond or soya milk) 200ml water 2 tbsp 0% fat Greek yoghurt 30g dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids), coarsely grated For the cherry compôte: 300g cherries, stoned 2 tbsp water 2 tbsp clear honey Method: Make the cherry compôte: put the cherries and water in a saucepan and poach gently over a low heat for 8–10 minutes until the cherries are tender but still hold their shape. Remove the cherries with a slotted spoon and add the honey to the juices in the pan. Turn up the heat and cook until reduced and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Pour over the cherries and set aside, or leave to cool, then cover and chill in the fridge until required. Put the porridge oats, salt, milk and water in a non-stick pan and bring to the boil, stirring. Reduce the heat to a bare simmer and cook gently, stirring, until thickened, smooth and creamy. Serve the porridge topped with the yoghurt and grated chocolate, and with the cherry compôte. Or you can try this: Use frozen cherries instead of fresh ones. Add some grated orange zest to the cherries. Recipes extracted from Eat To Sleep (£12.99, Vermillion).
