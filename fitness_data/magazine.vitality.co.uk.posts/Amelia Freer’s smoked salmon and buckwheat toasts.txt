Amelia Freer’s smoked salmon and buckwheat toasts. Smoked salmon is a must-have for Christmas, plus it’s a great source of protein and omega-3. Serve on top of toasted gluten-free bread so everyone can tuck in. Makes 6 Prep time: 10 minutes Cook time: 5 minutes Ingredients: 50g cooked beetroot ½ tsp grated horseradish 1 lemon, cut into 8 wedges 2-3 thin slices buckwheat bread 75g smoked salmon Few dill sprigs to garnish Method: Put the beetroot and horseradish in the bowl of a small food processor. Squeeze in the juice from 2 of the lemon wedges and whizz together. Taste to check the seasoning, adding more horseradish if you like it peppery. Toast the thinly sliced buckwheat bread, then cut it into 6 small squares (roughly 4cm x 4cm). Top each slice with some beetroot, then the smoked salmon and a sprinkling of dill. Serve with the rest of the lemon wedges. For more healthy recipes, visit Amelia’s site . Follow her @ameliafreer . Want more Christmas canapé ideas?
