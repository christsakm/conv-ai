Vegan Panna Cotta with Mango Purée Recipe. Published: 31 August 2021. Recipe by: Natalie Thomson. A traditional Italian panna cotta calls for luscious cream and often gelatine, but this vegan version uses rich coconut cream and a handy plant-based setting agent. Summer in a pud! Prep time: 15 minutes Cook time: 10 minutes Serves: 4 You’ll need: 600ml coconut milk 200ml vegan cream 6 tbsp caster sugar 1 tsp vanilla bean paste 8g agar-agar (vegan gelatine substitute) 300g mango, diced 1 lime, zested and juiced What to do: Heat the coconut milk, vegan cream and 4 tbsp of the sugar in a saucepan. Add in the vanilla bean paste and the agar-agar, bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes, then allow to cool for 5 minutes. Divide the mixture between 4 serving glasses and place in the fridge to set. Meanwhile, make the sugar syrup. Heat the remaining 2 tbsp of sugar in a saucepan with 50ml water until it dissolves. Blitz the mango with the sugar syrup and lime juice until completely smooth. Set aside until the panna cotta has set. Once the panna cotta is firm, top with a layer of mango puree and sprinkle over the lime zest. Serve either cool from the fridge or at room temperature.
