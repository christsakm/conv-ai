Cool Down Session for the Gym with Nuffield Health. Published: 9 April 2021. In collaboration with Nuffield Health. After returning to the gym and completing your workout, it’s important to take time to cool down at the end of your session. It always seems easy to miss stretching at the end of a session, with it’s the perfect way to lower your heart rate and stretch out your muscles, especially if you’ve been weightlifting or doing intense exercises. We’ve teamed up with Nuffield Health and asked one of their Personal Trainers, Zahra, to show us the most effective stretching and cool down movements to perform at the end of a workout. This cool down is designed for both beginner and intermediate levels. Depending on how much time you have available, you can spend as long as you like cooling down and stretching. There are 5 exercises and each should be held for 30-40 seconds per move, repeated 2x through: Chest and back stretch March with full body stretch Alternating dynamic hamstring stretch Shoulder stretch Quad stretch What workout are you going to do next in the gym? We look at why plyometric training is a good option if you’re ready to try something different in the gym!
