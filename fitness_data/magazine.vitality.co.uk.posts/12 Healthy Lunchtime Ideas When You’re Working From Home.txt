If you’re working from home, you may find that you’ve fallen out of your lunchtime routine. When you’re not in your usual work environment, it’s easy to forgo your usual routine. You may end up accidentally working through lunch, or eat at different times than you’re accustomed to. Finding a new lunchtime groove Consistent routines add structure to our days, which can help us feel grounded. Establishing a new routine, including what you’ll eat and when, can help maintain a sense of normalcy, and your healthy habits. That’s why it’s important to make time for a proper break at lunchtime, and a proper meal, to ensure you’re fuelled and energised for the afternoon. (You might even find you’ve got more time to prep, cook and enjoy lunch now that you’re working from home.) From baked potatoes to hearty soups, make a healthy lunch a daily habit with the 12 delicious recipes below.
