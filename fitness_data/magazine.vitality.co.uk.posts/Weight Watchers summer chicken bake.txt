Put the potatoes and carrots into a roasting dish and spray with low fat cooking spray, turning to coat them. Add the rosemary sprigs. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the oven and roast for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, use a sharp knife to cut a pocket into the thickest part of each chicken breast.

To check, insert a sharp knife into the thickest part of the chicken – the juices should run clear. Serve the chicken with the roasted vegetables.
