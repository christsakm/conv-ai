Leave to cool for 15 minutes and scoop out the flesh. Blitz until smooth in a food processor. To make the pumpkin and orange granola Preheat the oven to 190°C, fan 170°C, gas 5. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl – oats, pecan nuts, sunflower seeds, brown sugar, mixed spice and salt. Combine the wet ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl – coconut oil, maple syrup, pumpkin puree and orange zest. Microwave on high for 60 seconds, checking it once in between. Stir until it resembles runny honey. Mix the dry and wet ingredients together until well coated and transfer to a parchment lined baking tray. Press the granola down into the tray with the help of another piece of parchment on top and smooth out the surface. The granola should be tightly packed if you want to cut them into squares. But don’t worry if it crumbles a bit, it still taste delicious. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, checking at the 20 minute mark to make sure it’s baking evenly. Take it out of the oven, cool for an hour before cutting into squares and transfer into to an airtight container. They will keep well for a couple weeks. Enjoy as a snack or crumble them over yogurt and fruit or porridge. Get your Weight Watchers 6 month pass for just £30 Sign up now Terms and conditions apply.
