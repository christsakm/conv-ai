How to spatchcock a chicken. This month, top chef and food writer Myles Williamson is giving us his brilliant BBQ recipes and tips. Check out his recipe for this smoky chipotle chicken with grilled corn and roast peppers. 1. Place the bird breast-side down on a chopping board, with the legs facing towards you. Using a clean pair of kitchen scissors, cut one side of the parsons nose, working your way along the backbone and through the ribs, until it is split in half. 2. Repeat this cut on the other side of the parsons nose, keeping close to the backbone to remove it (discard or freeze in a sandwich bag for up to 1 month for making stock). 3. Turn the chicken over and spread it out, then press firmly with the heel of your hand on the breastbone to flatten and make it an even thickness. Secure the chicken with long, metal skewers, if liked.
