Keema lamb tacos. Making your own tortillas is a great way to eat on a budget. They are really simple to make, cost pennies and make a little filling go a long way. This recipe uses a tasty keema lamb curry in a taco, Mexican street-food style. Makes one portion (multiply ingredients for extra servings). Ingredients: 40g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 25ml cold water ½ red onion, sliced 75g minced lamb 1 tsp curry powder Small handful of spinach 1 tbsp yogurt (or crème fraîche) 1 spring onion, sliced lengthways Olive oil Salt and pepper Method: Mix the flour and water in a bowl with a pinch of salt to form a dough. Knead on the work surface for a minute or two until you get a smooth dough. Cut it into three balls and roll each ball out into roughly 10cm circles. Heat a dry frying pan over a high heat, add a circle of dough and cook for 2 minutes on each side, until nicely toasted. Set to one side and repeat with the remaining dough. Pan-fry the onion in a splash of olive oil over a medium heat for a few minutes until softened, then add the lamb, season with salt and pepper, add the curry powder and cook for about 10 minutes. When the lamb is cooked, throw in the spinach and let it wilt. Now, assemble the tacos. Spoon some filling onto each taco, drizzle with yoghurt and top with spring onion.
