Warm chorizo, tomato and chickpea salad. Stuck for packed lunch inspiration? This salad takes just 10 minutes in the morning to pull together, and you’ll have a warm, satisfying meal to eat at lunchtime. Just a small amount of chorizo gives you loads of flavour. Serves 1 Ingredients: 50g chorizo sausages, roughly sliced 2 spring onions, diagonally sliced ½ red pepper, deseeded and sliced 1 handful baby plum or cherry tomatoes, cut in half 50g cooked chickpeas, rinsed Freshly ground black pepper 1 large handful rocket leaves Wedge of lemon, to serve Method: Heat a non-stick frying pan and add the chorizo, spring onions and pepper. There’s no need to add oil, as the chorizo will release oil as it cooks. Cook for 8 minutes, stirring often, until the chorizo is cooked and has slightly charred edges. Add the tomatoes and chickpeas, and stir through. Add plenty of black pepper. Tip the mixture into a vacuum food flask, add the rocket leaves and seal. Pack the wedge of lemon to take with you, if using. Time to eat… Squeeze the lemon over the salad before eating. The rocket leaves will have wilted slightly in the heat, and the chorizo and peppers should still be warm. Kitchen tip: If you can find them, try using brown chickpeas for this salad – they are smaller and nuttier than regular chickpeas. Packed with… Chickpeas are little powerhouses of goodness.
