A healthier gingerbread recipe for your festive baking list. Now this might be a big call but we think gingerbread is one of the best festive bakes out there – do you agree? With this in mind we simply had to share with you our gingerbread recipe – however this recipe has had Vitality makeover. It’s healthier than a traditional gingerbread recipe, and while we would always recommend everything in moderation, this recipe includes healthier ingredient swaps so you can get as much nutritional value out of this festive bake as possible, without sacrificing any delicious Christmassy flavour. You’ll need: – 250g wholemeal spelt flour – 1 tsp baking soda – 1 tbsp ground ginger – 1 ½ tsp cinnamon – 3 tbsp plant based milk (almond or oat) – 40g coconut oil – 1 tsp vanilla extract – Pinch of salt – 3 tbsp maple syrup – 100g coconut sugar (or light muscovado sugar) – 1 tbsp date syrup or molasses – Icing sugar (optional) Method: – Melt the oil on a low heat (the low heat avoids the coconut oil burning) – Combine all dry ingredients in a mixing bowl – Combine all wet ingredients and coconut sugar in a separate bowl and whisk together – In parts, slowly add the dry ingredients into the wet until fully combined – Wrap the dough mixture in cling film and refrigerate for minimum of 1hr – Pre-heat oven to 180 degrees celcius – Roll dough out the dough, cut out festive shapes and place on a lined baking tray – Bake for 10-12 minutes – Ice to your taste!
