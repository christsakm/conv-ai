Beetroot Virgin Mary. This is a healthier version of the classic Bloody Mary, using beetroot juice as the base. The nutrient-rich juice is earthy and sweet, but be mindful that beetroots have the highest sugar content of any vegetable Serves 2 You will need: Large jug 2 tall glasses Ingredients 500ml beetroot juice Juice of 2 limes (reserve the juiced halves) 1 tsp Tabasco sauce 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce 1 tsp celery salt Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Ice cubes Freshly grated horseradish to garnish 2 celery sticks to stir Method Mix the lime juice, Tabasco and Worcestershire sauces, and the celery salt together in a large jug, add the beetroot juice and put it in the fridge to cool. If you like, rub the juiced lime halves around the rims of the tall glasses, then dip the rims into a saucer containing the salt and freshly ground pepper. Otherwise, simply ﬁll the glasses with ice and top up with the beetroot juice. Add some freshly grated horseradish and serve with a celery stick.
