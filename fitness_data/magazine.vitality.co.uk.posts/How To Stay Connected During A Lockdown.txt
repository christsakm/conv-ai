How To Stay Connected During A Lockdown. We’re living in unique times, where spending more time at home is the new normal for many of us. Without being able to drop by and visit in person, it can be tricky to stay connected with our loved ones as we perhaps usually would. But with isolation leaving many feeling cut-off, it’s more important than ever to stay in touch with our loved ones – even if we can’t physically be with them. Here are some tips to help you stay close to your friends and family whilst staying home. Schedule in regular calls and video calls with loved ones – there’s lots of apps and options out there for different phones and devices. And don’t forget the regular landline for relatives who might not be digital. Calls don’t have to just be for a catch up – you can play games, or even prop your phone up for a video call whilst eating your dinner to make it feel like you’re together. Quizzes are fun for the whole family to get involved in – gather a team, give each household their own round to write questions for, or take it turns to host a weekly quiz, with a household crowned a winner at the end of each week.
