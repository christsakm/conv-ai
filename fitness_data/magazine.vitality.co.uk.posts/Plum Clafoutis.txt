Plum Clafoutis. “If you can make a Yorkshire pud, you can make this heavenly plum pud,” says Prue Leith. “If you can get hold of damsons, so much the better, but cherries, greengages, peaches and apricots are all delicious too.” Serves: 4–6 Ingredients: For the pudding: 1 tsp vanilla extract 150ml milk 100ml double cream 4 medium eggs 100g caster sugar 30g plain flour A pinch of salt 20g butter 1 tbsp soft brown sugar 6 large plums or 400g damsons 1½ tsp ground allspice To serve: Icing sugar Single cream (optional) Method: Heat the oven to 180°C/fan 160°C/gas mark 4. Blend the vanilla, milk, double cream, eggs, caster sugar, flour and salt together in a liquidizer, then leave for the flour to swell in the liquid for 20 minutes or so. Meanwhile, spread the butter in a wide, shallow 1.25-litre baking dish. Sprinkle in the brown sugar. Halve and stone the plums or damsons and spread out evenly in the dish. Dust the allspice over them, then roast for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately pour over the batter. Bake in the middle of the oven for 35 minutes. The clafoutis should be risen and brown. Dust with icing sugar and serve at once, with cream if liked. Recipe extracted from My All-Time Favourite Recipes by Prue Leith (£25, Bluebird)
