Peach and lemongrass cup. Why not swap the Pimms for this showstopper? It smells wonderful, and the woody, citrus notes of lemongrass stop it from becoming too sweet. This is one to make when the shops and markets are full of peaches, and you can come home with a whole boxful Serves 2 You will need: Tumblers Muddler Jug Ingredients ½ stalk lemongrass, cut in half lengthways A large sprig of mint 1 ripe peach, sliced into wedges 250ml cloudy apple juice 1 lemon, thinly sliced Ice cubes Sparkling water 2 stalks of lemongrass, to stir Method Muddle the ½ stalk lemongrass and the sprig of mint in a jug.
