Grilled peaches with vanilla yoghurt. This month, top chef and food writer Myles Williamson is giving us his brilliant BBQ recipes and tips. Serves: 4-8 portions Prepare: 5 minutes, plus barbecue setup time Cook: 5 minutes Ingredients 4 Peaches (ripe but not too soft), halved and de-stoned 4 tbsp Heather or other floral honey, plus extra to drizzle 200ml Greek strained natural yogurt 1 tsp Vanilla bean paste Method 1. Set up your barbecue. If using charcoal, light your barbecue 30-40 minutes ahead of time, let the coals turn ashen and glowing, then bank them to one side. Preheat a covered gas barbecue with the burners set over the highest heat for 10 minutes to get it nice and hot. 2. In a small bowl, mix together 2 tbsp honey with the yogurt and vanilla until combined, then set aside to serve. Grill the peaches, cut-side down on the hottest part of barbecue, for about 3-4 minutes until charred and just starting to soften. Flip over and brush the charred surfaces with the final 2 tbsp honey. Divide between plates, serving with the vanilla yogurt and a drizzle more honey, if liked.
