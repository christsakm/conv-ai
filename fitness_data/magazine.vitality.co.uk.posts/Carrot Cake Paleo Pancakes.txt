Carrot Cake Paleo Pancakes. The carrot forms some of the bulk to help lower the calories while increasing the levels of Vitamins A and C. The recipe calls for a combination of a whole egg and egg whites – so it contains protein but also limits the fat and calories. It’s not completely guilt free though, with fat and calories coming from the ground almonds and full fat coconut milk, but again these are rich in the good fats and Vitamin E, which is good for skin health. It also contains walnuts, which are a great source of Omega 3 – good for brain function and cholesterol levels. It’s spiced up a bit with dashes of cinnamon and ginger, which help to balance blood sugars and aid digestion. This pancake would be great for a breakfast with some natural yoghurt and fresh orange segments, or as an indulgent dessert with a spoonful of coconut ice cream on top. Makes 6 Ingredients: 100g coarsely grated carrot 1 whole egg 2 egg whites 60g ground almonds 125g tinned coconut milk 30g chopped walnuts 2 tablespoon coconut oil 2 tablespoon coconut flour ½ teaspoon baking powder ½ teaspoon baking soda ¼ teaspoon salt ½ tsp. each: cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg 30g raisins 2 tbsp. maple syrup Method: Mix all dry ingredients together in a large bowl: ground almonds, coconut flour, baking soda and powder, and spice together.
