Slow-Roasted Peppers, Aubergines And Tomatoes With Basil And Almond Dressing. Chef Rukmini Iyer shares this Spanish-inspired vegan dish. It will serve two people generously, or bring the vegetables to the table whole before ‘carving’ and dressing them alongside a side of grains. Serves: 2-3 Prep: 10 minutes Cook: 1 hour Ingredients: 2 whole aubergines, pricked all over with a fork 3 Romano peppers 6 large vine tomatoes 1 red onion, quartered A handful of fresh thyme sprigs 4 large cloves of garlic, unpeeled 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 teaspoons sea salt 50g whole almonds 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil 25g fresh basil, roughly torn or chopped To serve Good crusty bread Method: Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas mark 6. Tip the whole aubergines, red peppers, vine tomatoes, onion, thyme, garlic, olive oil and 1 teaspoon of salt into a large roasting tin, then use your hands to coat everything really well in the oil and salt. Transfer to the oven and roast for 1 hour, adding the almonds for the last 10 minutes of cooking time just to toast them. Remove the tin from the oven – the veg should be charred all over and very soft when prodded. Take out the garlic and place it in a small bowl, then use the back of a spoon to squeeze out the delicious roasted garlic. In a separate bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, oil and the rest of the salt, then add to the roasted garlic pulp, mixing it all thoroughly to make a smooth dressing. Use a knife and fork to remove the inedible tops and stems, then roughly tear apart the softened vegetables. Scatter over the basil and the dressing, then mix together really well. Serve warm with crusty bread. Recipe extracted from The Green Roasting Tin (£16.99, Square Peg) If you’re looking to build healthy habits, why not try WW – the new Weight Watchers?
