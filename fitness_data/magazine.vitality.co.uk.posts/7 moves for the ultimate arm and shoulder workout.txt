Tricep dips Try the same move, without the bench – slowly lowering your body down and transferring your weight into your arms and not your feet to tone the back of your arms. https://magazine.vitality.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1_TRICEP-DIPS.mp4 3. Shoulder press-up Take the usual press-up position but move your feet forward and raise your hips.

Burpees Squat with your hands on the floor in front of you, jump feet back to a plank position and drop to a press-up.
