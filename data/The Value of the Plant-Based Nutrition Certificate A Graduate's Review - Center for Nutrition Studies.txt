The Value of the Plant-Based Nutrition Certificate A Graduate's Review - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>Someone once asked me if the course is worth the money. Short answer, a resounding YES. Since earning my Plant-Based Nutrition Certificate from the T. Colin Campbell Center for Nutrition Studies and eCornell in 2009, I have been greatly rewarded in many ways that I never anticipated at the time.</p>, <p>For example, I met with another graduate of the program. A doctor of public health, he’s enjoyed a rich career in government and academia; now serving on the Harvard faculty in the department of public health. He also served as a special advisor to the U.S. Senate Committee charged with rewriting our federal health care system during the past few years. We met to discuss a few ideas for changing the world — by leveraging the simple principles of plant-based nutrition. Without my taking the eCornell Plant-Based Nutrition program online, this meeting would never have happened. </p>, <p>Below is a question I received regarding the certificate program:</p>, <p><em>“Mr. Hicks, I enjoy your blog and your book. I am interested in your thoughts on Dr. Campbell’s certificate course from eCornell. It is something I am considering, but my question is about the course content. I have read The China Study and much of the print material from Drs. Fuhrman, McDougall, Esselstyn and others. Does the course material enhance this information, or repeat it? I would appreciate your thoughts.<br>
Regards, John”</br></em></p>, <p><strong>My response</strong>. As a writer, blogger and speaker in the field of diet and health, I am very glad that I earned a certificate in Plant-Based Nutrition from the Center for Nutrition Studies and eCornell. Here are my primary reasons for feeling that way; they go far beyond just the knowledge that you will gain from the course.</p>, <p><strong>Bottom line.</strong> I’d say go for it; it may be the best money you’ll ever spend.</p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
