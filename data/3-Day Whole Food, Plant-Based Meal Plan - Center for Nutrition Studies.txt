3-Day Whole Food, Plant-Based Meal Plan - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>An increasing number of people are transitioning to a whole food, plant-based (WFPB) lifestyle as a way to improve their health and reduce the risk of chronic disease, but making the switch means rethinking the way meals are planned and prepared. A plant-based diet meal plan includes a wide variety of:</p>, <p>What isn’t on the list? Meat (including poultry), fish, eggs, dairy products, <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/plant-based-tips-cooking-without-oil/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">oil</a> and processed foods. Working toward eliminating these foods from your diet has a range of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4991921/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">well-documented health benefits</a>, some of which you can start seeing within just a few weeks!</p>, <p>Although plant-based diets can be described as vegan because animal foods are absent, avoiding processed foods and oils takes the concept one step further. Known as a whole food, plant-based diet, this way of eating aims to include as many health-promoting foods as possible. For a more detailed breakdown of how and why to go the extra step and try a whole food, plant-based diet plan, see our <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/whole-food-plant-based-diet-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">comprehensive diet guide</a>.</p>, <p>Need some inspiration to jump-start your foray into a new lifestyle?
