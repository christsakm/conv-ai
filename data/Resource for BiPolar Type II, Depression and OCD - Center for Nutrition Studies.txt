Resource for BiPolar Type II, Depression and OCD - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p><strong>I’m curious to know if there are any resources or if you could point me in the direction to learn about natural ways of dealing with BiPolar Type II, Depression and OCD?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Interesting question; I just read an article about diabetes being much more common in those people with bipolar disease. It’s hard to know exactly what that means, though. Could there be a common cause? Could it be the difficulty of mental illness that leads to poor health behaviors or poor medical care? Could it be the medications that lead to metabolic changes? I don’t know, but I think an optimal diet is only like to help. It certainly won’t hurt.</p>, <p>There is a fantastic internal medicine doctor (no affiliation with TCCF) who uses lifestyle approaches to mental illness, including depression. Take a look at his site: <a href="https://www.nedleyhealthsolutions.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=291" target="_blank" title="Nedley Health Solutions">Nedley Health Solutions</a></p>, <p>Good luck! (Required disclaimer: this is not medical advice – it is very important that you see your doctor to discuss any changes you are thinking of making.)<br>
