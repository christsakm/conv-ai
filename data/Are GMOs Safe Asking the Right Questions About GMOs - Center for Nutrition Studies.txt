Are GMOs Safe Asking the Right Questions About GMOs - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>For this GMO article series, I interviewed Jonathan R. Latham, PhD, co-founder and Executive Director of the <a href="https://bioscienceresource.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bioscience Resource Project</a> and the Director of the Poison Papers project, to get answers to the questions we should really be asking about GMOs. </p>, <p>Since the invention of GMOs, safety has been a dominant concern. Although many reputable institutions—including the American Medical Association (AMA) and the World Health Organization (WHO)—endorse the safety of tested GMOs, and almost 90% of scientist members of AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science), according to a 2014 survey, believe it is “generally safe” to eat GMOs, there remains skepticism.<sup><a href="#cite-note-5">[5,</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite-note-10">10]</a></sup></p>, <p>After all, it’s one thing to believe and endorse a new product’s safety and another to actually prove it. So, how do we know GMOs are safe? And who is in charge of making sure?</p>, <p>As citizens, many of us trust that there are laws and institutions in place to regulate the market and protect our health and safety. Especially when it comes to controversial items like GMOs, we are assured that they are subject to rigorous scrutiny and testing before they are approved for sale. Yet, as comforting as this sounds, these claims have a hidden fine print. </p>, <p>First, though GMOs may be heavily tested, <em>none</em> of these tests explore the long-term impacts of GMOs on health. In fact, companies aren’t even required to test new GMOs for safety at all if their added components are “generally recognized as safe,” a claim which relies on the often untested assumption that genetically engineered “crops are largely the same as their conventional counterparts.”<sup><a href="#cite-note-4">[4]</a></sup> If a company does decide to perform any sort of safety test, it is usually a short-term rat feeding trial.<sup><a href="#cite-note-3">[3,</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite-note-4">4,</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite-note-8">8]</a></sup> The duration of these tests is so short that they cannot rule out slowly developing health issues like organ damage and cancer.<sup><a href="#cite-note-3">[3]</a></sup> Worst of all—the regulatory framework by which we assess the value of these inadequate and often optional tests is inconsistent and incomplete.<sup><a href="#cite-note-4">[4]</a></sup></p>]
