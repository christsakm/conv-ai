4 Plant-Based Recipes Bodybuilder Robert Cheeke Swears By - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>As a plant-based athlete for more than a quarter of a century, I have many favorite recipes that I have used to fuel my athletic endeavors. My focus for many years has been on consuming a large quantity of complex carbohydrates provided by whole plant-based foods, which also include a healthy level of proteins and fats—even for a bodybuilder! My nutrition approach was heavily influenced by the documentary film Forks Over Knives, and by the work of Dr. T. Colin Campbell. Most significantly, I learned a lot from the online Plant-Based Nutrition Certificate program offered by the Center for Nutrition Studies and Cornell University, which I took more than a decade ago. </p>, <p>I’ve been able to get the most out of my body on a plant-based diet without the use of sports supplements. As far as I’m aware, I’m one of the few people in the plant-based fitness industry to be completely free of the sports nutrition products that are ubiquitous in the sport. No protein powders, creatine, branched-chain amino acids; no powders, bars, and oils! Though my plant-based diet is not completely free of processed foods, added oils, and added sugars, the foundation of my diet is whole plant foods, and I believe that nutritional base has effectively propelled me into the best shape I’ve ever been in, even now in my forties. </p>, <p>The following short list includes some of my favorite plant-based recipes, which also happen to be outstanding meals for supporting an active lifestyle. They’re great for an amateur fitness enthusiast, a professional athlete, or anyone in between. I shared these recipes in my New York Times Bestseller, The Plant-Based Athlete, for which I was incredibly honored and grateful to receive Dr. Campbell’s gracious endorsement. </p>, <p>Please note that I personally do not place any particular emphasis on high protein consumption, and in fact, I have consumed  a level of protein that many in the sport would consider low to moderate intake. However, some of the wording of the following recipes do reference particularly “high protein” plant foods. I do this to appeal to omnivorous individuals, some of whom have been conditioned to believe there aren’t any high protein plant foods. I like to show them that indeed plants have all the protein we need. </p>, <p>Enjoy some of my favorite plant-based athlete recipes! </p>, <p><img alt="Green Smoothie" src="https://cdn.nutritionstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/4-plant-based-recipes-bodybuilder-robert-cheeke-swears-by1.png"/></p>, <p>This is a super-sized smoothie that’s perfect for breakfast, pre-workout, or even post-workout.

During warmer months, it’s refreshing<br/>
and enjoyable either at room temperature or chilled. By using red lentil pasta, which only has one<br/>
ingredient (red lentil flour), this dish is naturally rich in carbohydrates and protein, and it also has heft and texture to make for a very satisfying and filling meal. This is also an excellent<br/>
meal to serve at a gathering with people new to a plant-based diet because all ingredients<br/>
are recognizable for vegans and non-vegans alike, plus it’s<br/>
gluten-free and really, really tasty.</p>, <p>Serves 6</p>, <p>1 (8-ounce) package red lentil pasta<br/>
2 cups spinach<br/>
1 pint sweet cherry or grape tomatoes<br/>
1 (14-ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained<br/>
1/2 large bell pepper, seeded<br/>
1 (6-ounce) can black olives, drained<br/>
1 (15-ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed<br/>
⅓–½ cup Italian dressing<br/>
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</p>, <p>1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the lentil pasta according to package instructions.<br/>
2. While the pasta cooks, coarsely chop the spinach, cut the tomatoes into bite-sized pieces (halves or thirds), slice the artichokes, dice the bell pepper, and slice the olives.<br/>
3. Drain the pasta and rinse under cold water. Transfer the pasta to a large mixing bowl. Add the beans and the vegetables. Pour enough dressing over the salad to coat, then toss tocombine.<br/>
4. Season with pepper to taste. Store any leftovers in the fridge for up to 1 week.</p>, <p>Nutritional Totals Per Serving:<br/>

It’s one of those dishes that makes a big batch and tastes even better<br/>
the next day, so it’s perfect for cooking over the weekend and eating throughout the week. You could also transfer it to smaller containers and store it in the freezer until you’re ready to<br/>
defrost and reheat. It never gets old because you can load it up with your favorite toppings.</p>, <p>Serves 4</p>, <p>2 cloves garlic, minced<br/>
1/2 onion, diced<br/>
