 Vitamin C is no stranger to controversy. It took 40 years between when citrus fruits were shown to cure scurvy in the 1700’s and their widespread application. Is it possible we’re in the midst of a similar 40 year lag between vitamin C discovery and implementation? Research in the mid-70’s by Linus Pauling (considered the greatest chemist of the 20th century) purported to show that terminal cancer patients treated with vitamin C lived four times longer, and sometimes even 20 times longer than those who hadn’t. Alternative medicine practitioners continue to treat thousands of cancer patients with vitamin C, but why isn’t it the standard of care in mainstream medicine? Has it been successfully debunked or is it a Big Pharma conspiracy to suppress the truth? Find out what the science shows in my three-part video series coming soon to NutritionFacts.org:
