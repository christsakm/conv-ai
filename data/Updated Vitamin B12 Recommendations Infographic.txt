 Vitamin B12 is not made by plants or animals, but by microbes that blanket the earth. In today’s sanitized, modern world, the water supply is commonly chlorinated to kill off any bacteria. So, while we don’t get much B12 in the water anymore, we don’t get much cholera, either, which is a good thing! A regular, reliable source is critical for anyone eating a plant-based diet.  What does the latest research on B12 say? This infographic is a summary of the main takeaways and my updated recommendations.    Get this infographic as a PDF here.
