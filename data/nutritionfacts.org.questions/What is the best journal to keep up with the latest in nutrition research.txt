What is the best journal to keep up with the latest in nutrition research If you would recommend one journal for a busy biology student to read to keep up with the latest nutrition research, what would it be? Victor Van Epps / Originally posted on Nation’s diet in crisis Answer: My favorite journal is probably the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , but I strive to at least skim through every issue of most every English-language nutrition journal in the world (see my list here ). The few you’ll note missing from my list are mostly industry journals (like New Horizons In Nutrition And Health , published by none other than The Butter Council), which are great for comic relief but don’t make my must-read list.
