Is the new vitamin D3 spray a waste of money  NutritionFacts.org Dr. Greger — have you heard about the new vitamin D3 spray? What is your opinion — helpful? Harmful? Waste of money? Thanks! vfayes / Originally posted on Vitamin D supplements may be necessary Answer: Based on their current pricing, supplementing with that product would cost hundreds of dollars a year. Given the fact that at the preferred daily dosing D2 and D3 appear to be equivalent , I would suggest choosing a less expensive option (D2 is easily 10 times cheaper and even the same company’s D3 capsules are less expensive). Just think about how much kale you could buy with all the money you save! Image credit: sskennel / Flickr
