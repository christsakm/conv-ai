Soy-Based vs. Mycoprotein-based Veggie Chicken Which is Better Is this a soy-based or mycoprotein-based fake chicken???? I don’t eat any soy, but I do eat some mycoprotein (QUORN). Would love your opinion on it. wickedchicken / Originally posted on Chicken vs. Veggie Chicken Answer: Great question wickedchicken (and true to your namesake :). Gardein (from “garden + protein”) is a soy and grain (wheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa)-based product. Quorn is more like (though technically not) mushroom based. Unlike Gardein, most Quorn products have a little saturated fat and cholesterol (has some egg and milk products mixed in), both of which we should try to minimize (please see my video Trans Fat, Saturated Fat, and Cholesterol: Tolerable Upper Intake of Zero ). Quorn has more sodium, less protein, and comparable fiber, but regardless, both are superior to chicken the animal for a variety of reasons (e.g., Chicken vs. Veggie Chicken and my 40 videos on chicken ).
