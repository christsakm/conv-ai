What about pepper plus turmeric in V8 juice  NutritionFacts.org I stirred 1 teaspoon of powdered amla into my daily glass of V8 juice, along with a sprinkle of black pepper and 1/2 teaspoon turmeric – tasted OK. soupy / Originally posted below Amla: Indian gooseberries vs. cancer, diabetes, and cholesterol Answer: That’s an even better idea than you might know! Check out my video on food synergy Garden Variety Anti-Inflammation and my blog post Fighting Inflammation With Food Synergy , documenting evidence that when certain foods are eaten together the sum of nutritive value may be greater than the parts. And there is indeed an amazing reaction that takes place between the phytonutrients in black pepper and turmeric. Eating black pepper at the same time as turmeric boosts the bioavailability of curcumin–the chief purported cancer fighter in turmeric–by (you sitting down?) 2000% ! My only suggestion would be to choose the low-salt V8, as there is new evidence on just how bad sodium may be for the heart. See also my video Salt OK if Blood Pressure is OK?
