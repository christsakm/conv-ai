Is the Eat Right For Your Type (blood type) diet fact or fiction Some people I know tell me that because they are not a Blood Type A, they need to eat meat or dairy or whatever; and I know people who claim that they were vegan for blah blah years and they almost died, and felt so much better after they started eating the meat or dairy or whatever again. I don’t know what to say to them. Veguyan / Originally posted on Dietary guidelines: pushback from the sugar, salt, and meat industries Answer: I was just actually interviewed about D’Adamo’s Blood Type Diet astrology in the Chicago Tribune . Probably best summed up by a quote from a review published in the Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association : “The theories of D’Adamo must be viewed as lacking a scientific basis and should not be taken seriously….[H]ad D’Adamo been practicing in Norway, his practice would have been a violation of the so-called quack law….[I]t is difficult not to see the whole thing as a crass fraud.” Image Credit: Andrew Mason / Flickr
