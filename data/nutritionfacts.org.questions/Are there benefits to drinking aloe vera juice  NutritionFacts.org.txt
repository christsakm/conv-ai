Are there benefits to drinking aloe vera juice  NutritionFacts.org Any opinions on aloe vera juice? earthgypsy / Originally posted on Bowel Movements: the scoop on poop Answer: A recent randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled study failed to find any benefit of aloe vera over placebo in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. There is, however, evidence that peppermint oil may help. In general, the available science suggests that the purported benefits of aloe are overblown , and given recent reports of aloe-induced hepatitis , I would recommend against ingesting it. Applied topically, though, to second degree (blistering) burns, aloe vera does seem to accelerate healing . Thank you so much for your question–I’m always happy to look things up for folks!
