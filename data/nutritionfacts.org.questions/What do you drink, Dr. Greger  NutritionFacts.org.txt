What do you drink, Dr. Greger  NutritionFacts.org Dr. Greger ~ Are you still drinking that yummy Hibiscus Tea? (I did not see it in your “morning mix”!) Kenton R. Mullins  / Originally Posted in A Better Breakfast Answer: A half gallon a day Kenton! I no longer do the teabags, though, but the bulk dried hibiscus flowers themselves (why hibiscus? See Better Than Green Tea? ). My current recipe is a handful of dried hibiscus petals in 8 cups of water with a penny sized chunk of fresh ginger root (see Plants vs. Pesticides ), handful of fresh mint leaves ( Antioxidants in a Pinch ), teaspoon of amla ( Amla: Indian gooseberries vs. cancer, diabetes, and cholesterol ), and erythritol to taste (3 tablespoons for me–see A Harmless Artificial Sweetener )–all blended up in a high speed blender and then sipped throughout the day. I’m on the road right now and I sure miss my concoction! Anyone have any suggestions for improving it even further (taste or nutrition-wise)? UPDATE: Due to concerns about the manganese content, I’ve cut back to a quart a day of filtered. image credit: Emily Barney / Flickr
