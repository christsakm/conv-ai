I regular cocoa powder healthier than alkali-processed dutched cocoa Cocoa comes from the cacao bean, and like other beans, has wonderful health-promoting flavanol phytonutrients, like in green tea. What Are The Health Benefits of Cocoa? Lowers blood pressure Lowers bad cholesterol Boosts good cholesterol Unstiffens arteries Boosts the immune system Combats the effects of aging Treatment of chronic fatigue Check out my video Cocoa Good; Chocolate Bad for more. Why Is Cocoa Processed With Alkali? Flavanols are what give cocoa its bitterness. Processing with alkali destroys them to improve taste. Isn’t Regular Cocoa Powder Healthier Than Alkali-processed “Dutched” Cocoa? Alkali-processed “dutched” cocoa is not as healthy (See Update on Chocolate for the graph and Healthiest Chocolate Fix for some other chocolate comparisons). Dutched cocoa can have as few as half the phytonutrients, but that just means you have to use twice as much! Making things even more chocolatey has never been a problem for me, and I just like the taste so much better that my household uses Dutch (like for our healthy chocolate milkshake recipes), but if the taste of regular cocoa works for you, then go for it–you’re getting even more benefit per spoonful!
