Are neurotoxins only present in blue-green algae  NutritionFacts.org As you have reported, the effects of animal based omega-3 supplements can prove to be ironically, inflammatory. While you recommend utilizing algae as an alternative, is there concern over the neurotoxins (as you have discussed in other videos as present in spiralina), or are these only present in the blue-green algae? GrantMM77ni / Originally posted in Plant-Based Omega-3 Supplements Answer: All the algae-oil omega-3 supplements currently on the market are made from phytoplankton that are in an entirely different biological kingdom than the blue-green algae known to produce toxins (such as spirulina, detailed here: https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/blue-green-algae/ ).
