Where does the fat come from in a skinless chicken breast There is so little visible fat on chickens e.g. a skinless chicken breast. I don’t see how it’s such a high ratio. wickedchicken / Originally posted on Does eating obesity cause obesity? Answer: Much of the fat in chicken is in the muscle (meat) itself, what’s called intramyocellular lipid, where droplets of fat build up inside the muscle cell itself. In fact that’s why chickens are used as experimental models of human obesity, since the buildup of fat inside our own muscles is thought to contribute to the insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes, and chickens are one of the few animals fat enough to mirror our obese population. This month in the medical journal Stress , for example, a team of Chinese scientists found that stress hormones may actually facilitate this process of fat accumulation within the muscles of chickens, raising the question of whether the conditions in which most chickens are raised these days may indeed be making their nutritional profile even worse as suggested in the “ Modern Organic and Broiler Chickens Sold for Human Consumption Provide More Energy from Fat than Protein ” article I profile in the Does Eating Obesity Cause Obesity? video.
