How much cinnamon is too much  NutritionFacts.org Does the anti-oxi value decrease with age of spice (or berry)? If so, how much? Second, how much is “toxic”? I heard taking more than 1-2 tbsns of cinnamon a day could be toxic. Is one hurting oneself if one takes 2 tbs of all the above mentioned spices a day? Evan Brand / Originally posted below Antioxidants in a pinch Answer: Please see my videos Oxalates in Cinnamon in terms of dosing and The Safer Cinnamon , which compares the safety of the four common types of cinnamon: Cinnamomum verum (“True cinnamon,” Sri Lanka cinnamon or Ceylon cinnamon) Cinnamomum burmannii (Korintje or Indonesian cinnamon) Cinnamomum loureiroi (Saigon cinnamon or Vietnamese cinnamon) Cinnamomum aromaticum (cassia or Chinese cinnamon) I’m working on a followup video for 2013 to review new evidence that Ceylon cinnamon may not be as effective in lowering blood sugar than the more concerning cassia.
