What is the recommended child requirement for vitamin D I just watched your newest video and it was fantastic as usual. The segment about the adult requirement of 2000 units/day for Vitamin D was interesting and helpful. Can you please tell me what a child’s requirement is likely to be? We have a three year old.

The official (Institute of Medicine) recommendation for those over 1 year of age is 600 IU a day of vitamin D. In two weeks I’m going to be rolling out a series of eight vitamin D videos from my volume 6 DVD offering justification for my 2000 iu. day recommendation for adults: Vitamin D Recommendations Changed Evolutionary Argument for Optimal Vitamin D Level Is Vitamin D the New Vitamin E?
