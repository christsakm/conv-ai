Is wheatgrass superior to any other green  NutritionFacts.org I am a fan of wheatgrass shots. Everything I have read about their benefit points to the high chlorophyll content. So I am wondering, is there any difference between wheatgrass and just plain dark leafy greens? If it is the chlorophyll that we are after, then why not just use dark leafy greens which are more readily available rather than go to the extra trouble of finding wheatgrass (although yes I understand dark leafy greens are good anyway) â€“ but my question specifically is : Is there some added benefit or reason why wheatgrass would be superior to any other green? cuisinegourmet / Originally posted on the NutritionFacts.org Facebook page Answer: There appears to be little evidence in the medical literature (running this search ) that wheatgrass juice has any special properties.
