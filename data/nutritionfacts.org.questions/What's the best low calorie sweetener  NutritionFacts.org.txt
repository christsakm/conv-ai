What's the best low calorie sweetener  NutritionFacts.org I was unable to understand the name of the sweetener you suggested in the recipe for homemade cranberry juice in the video of 12/03. I’d be grateful if you could send along the spelling of the product. Don Brix / Originally posted on Pink juice with green foam Answer: “Erythritol,” a nearly noncaloric sugar alcohol found naturally in certain fruits. I have a video about it here: A Harmless Artificial Sweetener . My family goes through about a pound a month. See, for example, our Pink Juice with Green Foam and healthy chocolate ice cream recipes. A study published last month adds a cautionary note, though: consuming erythritol with a large load of fructose (as can be found in certain confectionery and soft drinks) could inhibit fructose absorption in the small intestine and result in bloating and discomfort from fructose fermentation in the colon. I don’t imagine people would typically be mixing their diet and regular soda together, but if they did, it could be a bad combo. I have another erythritol video queued up from volume 11 so stay tuned and make sure you’re subscribed so you don’t miss it! Image Credit: Theculinarygeek / Flickr
