Is the plastic chemical BPA really harmful to your health I wish you had links to the studies. My dad thinks the whole BPA issue is a hoax (and human-caused climate change, too, if you can believe it). But, he claims to be a scientist, so putting a few good studies in his hands would help. Oh, he also doesn’t think there is an obesity epidemic in America. HereHere / Originally posted on Which plastics are harmful? Answer: Not sure if there’s any talking sense to a climate skeptic, but there are more than 1,000 free scientific articles on bisphenol A accessible through PubMed Central (PMC). Unlike straight PubMed, PMC indexes only articles that are free and open to the public (2 million to date!). Probably the most interesting study published this year on the topic was “Most plastic products release estrogenic chemicals: a potential health problem that can be solved,” which found endocrine disrupting chemicals even in “BPA-free” plastics, based on the in-vitro effects on estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cells. In some cases, BPA-free products released even more chemicals having estrogenic effects than BPA-containing plastic products. The good news is that a new study found that one could dramatically reduce one’s exposure to these chemicals (both BPA and “penis-shrinking” pthalates ) by choosing more fresh, unpackaged foods. There is, however, one non-canned fresh food item found BPA contaminated–see my video BPA Plastic and Male Sexual Dysfunction . Image Credit: stevendepolo / Flickr
