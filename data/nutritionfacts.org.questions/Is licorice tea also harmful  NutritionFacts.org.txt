Is licorice tea also harmful  NutritionFacts.org Does this also include the tea that I love to drink if so I will stop. ksk63 / Originally posted on Licorice Good For You? Answer: That is a great question. The only study I was able to find looked at a tea which included licorice root and concluded: “One cup of the herbal tea [“Smooth Move”] contains approximately 15 mg of glycyrrhizic acid, which is significantly below the level of concern for known side effects of licorice overdose.” I would still not recommend it for pregnant women , though.
