Can you take hydrogen peroxide internally  NutritionFacts.org I have a question regarding the use of hydrogen peroxide internally. I’m not finding much information on the subject and I have a family member who’s looking into it based on some (limited) online research. Thoughts and feedback would be appreciated. organicsauce / Originally posted on Glycotoxins Answer: Yikes! Hydrogen peroxide should never be taken internally. It can cause irritation of the gastrointestinal tract with nausea, vomiting, and foaming at the mouth (the foam may obstruct the respiratory tract or result in pulmonary aspiration). Within minutes of ingestion, confusion, coma, convulsions, cyanosis and cardiorespiratory arrest may ensue if the concentration is high enough. Oxygen gas embolism in the brain may cause a stroke even after just a few sips . Most problems occur at concentrations >10%, but even dilute solutions can be toxic . If your family member wants to oxygenate their blood they should try exercising! Instead of consuming pro-oxidants like hydrogen peroxide, I recommend eating anti-oxidant rich foods.
