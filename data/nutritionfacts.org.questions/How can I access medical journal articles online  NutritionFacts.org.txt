How can I access medical journal articles online  NutritionFacts.org Is there any way you can provide a pdf link to the articles you are referencing? I would love to read the full article. Drew / Originally posted on Meat Hormones & Female Infertility Answer: Whenever available I always try to provide PDF links to the full-text of the papers in the Sources Cited section beneath each video. More and more journal publishers are joining the “open access” movement to provide unrestricted online access (check out this graph to see the trend). Since many studies are taxpayer-funded, it only makes sense that we should have access to the results, right? Unfortunately, there are some holdouts, journals that continue to charge readers exorbitant rates to view papers they publish. In this case, you’re left with a few options: You can check WorldCat to see if there are any local institutions that have the journal in question (such as university libraries that may allow the public to browse). You can also request a copy (so-called “reprint”) from the author (usually they list a contact email address in the PubMed abstracts to which I link). Worse comes to worst, you can pay on the journal website or order it for a fee through the federal Loansome Doc program. I’m privileged to live biking distance from the National Library of Medicine and so have easy access to just about everything, but unfortunately it’s not legal for me to directly share copyright protected materials. Otherwise I would post all the papers on the site! Image Credit: CCAC North Library / Flickr
