Are GMOs safe and are the nutrients in our crops declining Please discuss GMOs and decreased nutrition in our foods. Mary Ellen / Originally posted on Nutrition education in medicine: A doctor a day keeps the apples away Answer: This answer is from 2012. Please see our more recent videos on GMOs here: https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gmos For a discussion on how much the nutrient content of food crops has declined over the last 50 years please see my video Crop Nutrient Decline . In terms of GMOs, I’ve published a few papers on the inclusion of genetically modified animals in the food supply (for example here and here ), but the relative risks and benefits of genetic engineering in crop agriculture is less clear. Unfortunately, the latest review on the safety of plant GMOs is not freely available, but an earlier review is. If one is interested in the two extremes of the debate I’d suggest Health Risks of Genetically Modified Foods on the “anti” side and Why Genetically Modified Crops? on the pro.
