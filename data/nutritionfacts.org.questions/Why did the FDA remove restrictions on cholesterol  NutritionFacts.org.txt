Why did the FDA remove restrictions on cholesterol  NutritionFacts.org Answered by: Thea I recommend you take a look at this article which explains how the Dietary Guidelines Committee got to their initial conclusion (which was later reversed). Very important details. As they say, the devil is in the details. And, as it turns out, when it came to the final/actual guidelines that got released (as opposed to the preliminary floater ideas), the Dietary Guidelines Committee did the very opposite of removing cholesterol limits form its dietary guidelines. The Dietary Guidelines Committee were forced to actually acknowledge the science. In the end, the Dietary Guidelines Committee strengthened their warning about cholesterol. You can read about it here . And here is a quote. The Guidelines state: “As recommended by the IOM, individuals should eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible … Strong evidence from mostly prospective cohort studies but also randomized controlled trials has shown that eating patterns that include lower intake of dietary cholesterol are associated with reduced risk of CVD, and moderate evidence indicates that these eating patterns are associated with reduced risk of obesity. … Dietary cholesterol is found only in animal foods such as egg yolk, dairy products, shellfish, meats, and poultry.” Sometimes the truth really does win. The problem is that many websites and the media didn’t bother to report what actually happened.
