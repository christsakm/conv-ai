What is the definition of a handful serving of nuts Just wondering what was their definition of a “handful” of nuts? 25 grams? 8 nuts? Big difference in opinion from one person to the next as to what is a “handful”. Many thanks. wickedchicken / Originally posted on Milk Protein vs. Soy Protein Answer: “Handful” of nuts typically refers to an ounce. So that’s like 23 almonds, 14 walnut halves, or 21 filberts (hazelnuts). The USDA nutrient database is the go-to place for weight (and nutrient) measurements: http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ For more on what just a few nuts can do, see my videos Fighting Inflammation in a Nut Shell and What Women Should Eat to Live Longer . Wouldn’t eating a handful of nuts make you fat, though? You’d be surprised–see my video Nuts and Obesity: The Weight of Evidence . Image Credit: IainBuchanan / Flickr
