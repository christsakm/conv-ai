Antioxidants in Pine Needles From Douglas Firs & redwoods I noticed that Pine Needles in a tea is a good antioxidant. I am wondering if needles from a Douglas Fir or redwood would have the same properties. I am Raw Vegan and always interested in the options. LynnCS / Originally posted on The Healthiest Vegetables Answer: Pine needles have so much vitamin C that pine needle tea has been used with great success historically as a cure for scurvy . On the other hand, there have been toxins found in the needles of some pines, so I would recommend sticking to more conventional dark green leafy leaves. If you want to be more adventurous, though, then the best resource Iâ€™m aware of is From Crabgrass Muffins to Pine Needle Tea by Linda Runyon. Ask for it in your local public library.
