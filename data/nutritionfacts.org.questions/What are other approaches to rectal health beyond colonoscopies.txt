What are other approaches to rectal health beyond colonoscopies Answered by: Thea I highly recommend taking a look at Dr. Greger’s two videos on colonoscopies, What to Take Before a Colonoscopy and Should We All Get Colonoscopies Starting at Age 50? The videos are very short. The videos reference the source studies, which you can see by clicking the ‘Sources Cited’ buttons to the right of the video if you are interested. There is also a transcript button if you want to take the text anywhere. I thought I would also refer you to Dr. McDougall’s article on colonoscopies . I would say that Dr. Greger is more, say conservative, than Dr. McDougall. But Dr. McDougall is well respected and has done a lot of research also. (Though I think of Dr. Greger as the king of research.) If nothing else, Dr. McDougall talks about how much of a bully doctors can be, which I think might give you some moral support. This more recent article from Dr. McDougall may also be of interest.
