Is cabbage effective against breast cancer  NutritionFacts.org I have read that new research says cabbage can be good against certain cancers but I don’t remember if breast cancer is one. Both of my grandmothers had breast cancer so I am VERY interested in breast health. Thank you for this information. I love mushrooms and my daughter and I will up our consumption. Is there a recommended weekly amount and any particular kind better than others? Raychel83 / Originally posted on Vegetables versus breast cancer Answer: I would have guessed broccoli myself! You’re absolutely right about the cancer-fighting effects of the cruciferous (cabbage-family) vegetables . See my video The Healthiest Vegetables , and if you’re interested in cabbage in particular, Superfood Bargains . Given your strong family history (sorry to hear about your grandmothers) please feel free to check out my 30 other videos on breast health . And in terms of which mushrooms are best, check out my video Breast Cancer Prevention: Which Mushroom Is Best? How many mushrooms should one shoot for in one’s weekly diet? I have that video queued up from my volume 11 DVD. It should be up in a few days–make sure you’re subscribed to my videos so you don’t miss it! Image credit: thebittenword.com / Flickr
