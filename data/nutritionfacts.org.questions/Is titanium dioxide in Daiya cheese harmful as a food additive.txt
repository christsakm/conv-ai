Is titanium dioxide in Daiya cheese harmful as a food additive I can’t believe this preservative is still allowed on store shelves!!! I am glad I refused to buy products with this additive in it, but it sure is ubiquitous. I notice that the vegan cheese by Daiya has titanium dioxide in it, and I’m concerned about how that might act within the body or react with other foods.

According to the World Health Organization’s IARC, there do not appear to be any problems associated with the consumption of titanium dioxide as a food additive. That said, there are a bunch of new studies out, which I’m currently reviewing, and will include a video on titanium dioxide in my 2013 batch.
