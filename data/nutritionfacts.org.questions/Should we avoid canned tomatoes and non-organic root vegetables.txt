Should we avoid canned tomatoes and non-organic root vegetables I’ve seen a number of blog posts about some food scientists stating that if you avoid ANY food, canned tomato products and non-organic root vegetables should be at the top of your list?  Do you know anything about these statements? Is it just the opinion of a few researchers or is there a lot of weight behind the recommendation to avoid those products Georgel / Originally asked on the NutritionFacts.org facebook page Answer: Did they offer any rationale? With canned tomato products are they concerned about the BPA? (see my videos Which Plastics are Harmful? and BPA Plastic and Male Sexual Dysfunction ). A recent study found that it was canned tuna that had the highest levels, whereas concentrations in canned vegetables was relatively low. And pesticides in root vegetables? Only one even made it into the Environmental Working Group’s top twenty list . If I had to pick a worst food it would probably be Crisco, processed meat, or some of the mentions in my blog post about Paula Deen . Image credit: Nomadic Lass / Flickr
