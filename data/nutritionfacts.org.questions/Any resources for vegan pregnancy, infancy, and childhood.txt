Any resources for vegan pregnancy, infancy, and childhood I feel our family has a healthy and complete diet (in no small part thanks to you!) but do you have any specific recommendations or guidelines for those who would like to follow a vegan diet through pregnancy, infancy and childhood? Is the most important thing (apart from healthy, whole foods) kid-friendly B12 and DHA, and probably D? hcdr / Originally posted below American vegans placing babies at risk Answer: There are two great new resources for those who want to raise their families on plant-based diets: one by Reed Mangels and one by Jack Norris and Ginny Messina . Ask for them at your local library. Image credit: cscott2006 / Flickr
