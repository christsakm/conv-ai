Are green smoothies better for you  NutritionFacts.org What about green smoothies? I blend apples, bananas, blueberries and spinach. Heidi Woodruff / Originally asked on Best fruit juice Answer: I’m a huge green smoothie fan! You’re taking the healthiest thing on the planet (dark green leafy vegetables) and releasing all that nutrition (you could never really chew that well). In fact I just wrote the foreword for the Complete Idiot’s Guide to Green Smoothies , which will be out May 2012. I’m currently compiling all the data in the scientific literature on the health effects of green smoothie consumption (for example there was a promising experimental trial recently performed in the UK). So stay tuned for a smoothie video in the 2013 batch I’m currently working on. Make sure you’re subscribed so you don’t miss it! Image credit: little blue hen / Flickr
