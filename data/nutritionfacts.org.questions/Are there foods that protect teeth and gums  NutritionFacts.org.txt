Are there foods that protect teeth and gums  NutritionFacts.org Do you have any advice on which plant foods or beverages can help prevent cavities and gum disease? OmarLittle / Originally asked on the NutritionFacts.org facebook page Answer: Normally we just hear about things to avoid to protect our teeth and gums (like candy, acidic juices, smoking, etc.) but what about things we should be eating? Last year an Italian review actually looked at the “anti-cariogenic” (cavity-fighting) properties of polyphenol phytonutrients (read full-text here ). Polyphenols are found in all flowering plants and have been ascribed anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer properties. There are thought to be more than 8,000 types. In the plant kingdom they serve a defensive role, including fighting off bacterial infections. Since cavities are primarily caused by bacteria eating away our tooth surfaces, researchers started looking into the potential of polyphenols to protect against cavities. And indeed they found that this class of phytonutrients could directly inhibit the growth of plaque bacteria and their ability to attach to teeth, produce acid, and produce the sticky “biofilm” we call plaque. My only caution is to hold off brushing your teeth for a half hour after eating acidic foods like berries, citrus, and vinegars to cut down on dental erosion.
