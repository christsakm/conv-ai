What are some options for trainings on Lifestyle Medicine I am a medical student and would like to obtain more training in nutrition and lifestyle medicine. Are there any residencies for Lifestyle Medicine?  If not, what are some other training opportunities that can I pursue? Answer: Thank you for sending in this question!  If you are like most US medical students, you got very little education about these topics in med school. I have several suggestions for you to expand your knowledge. First of all, there is no residency in “Lifestyle Medicine” that I know of.  You might want to check out the requirements for a Preventive Medicine Residency, which includes a degree in public health. There are several excellent conferences you should consider attending. 1) Plantrician Project Conference in Anaheim, CA, from Sept 21-24 2) American College of Lifestyle Medicine Conference in Naples, FL, from Oct 23-26.  It offers reduced rates for medical students. Both of these first two options also offer training in the CHIP program for a reduced price. 3) Plant-based Prevention of Disease Conference in Albuquerque, NM, May 18-20, 2017. Training programs: 1) eCornell certificate in Plant-Based Nutrition , an online course lasting 2 months, 30-36 total hours. 2) CHIP — see above.
