Are the nutrients from blended vegetables absorbed better than raw In regards to raw food nutrient absorption – Have there been any studies performed on blended raw vegetables versus raw vegetables (in their natural form) nutrient absorption. I’m advised that blended vegetables are more easily absorbed than eating the whole raw vegetable in its natural form. I suppose a lot has to do with how much blending (chewing) you do before swallowing the mouthful? sapire / Originally asked in Raw Food Nutrient Absorption Answer : As you can see here , the heating itself seems to improve the bioavailability of lycopene (the red pigment in tomatoes I talk about in the video ). I would not be surprised if the blending helped too, though, by breaking up all those cell walls (we could never really chew that good) so maybe you could blend and heat and have the best of both worlds? I’m currently compiling all the data in the scientific literature on the health effects of “green smoothie” consumption (for example there was a promising experimental trial recently performed in the UK). So stay tuned for a smoothie video in the 2013 batch I’m currently working on. Make sure you’re subscribed so you don’t miss it! Image Credit: Damien Pollet / Flickr
