How do you achieve a good omega 3 to omega 6 fatty acid ratio What would you suggest as an ideal omega 3,6,9? Eric / Originally asked on Avoiding Cholesterol is a No Brainer Answer: I try to think in terms of whole food sources rather than nutrients (have you read The China Study ? It has a whole chapter trying to make that point). I’d be happy to talk with you about ratios and percentages, but in terms of practical advice I’d encourage people to minimize their intake of the omega-6 rich oils (such as safflower, sunflower, and cottonseed, and all of the processed garbage manufacturers make with them), and try to eat healthy omega-3 rich whole foods such as walnuts and flax seeds every day (which have their own benefits–see for example my videos Fighting Inflammation in a Nut Shell , Black Versus English Walnuts , Breast Cancer Survival and Lignan Intake , and Just the Flax, Ma’am ). And especially for men as well as women who are expecting, breastfeeding, or even thinking about getting pregnant I would encourage consideration of taking an algae- or yeast-derived long-chain omega-3 supplement .
