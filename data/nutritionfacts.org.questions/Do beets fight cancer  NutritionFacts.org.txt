Do beets fight cancer  NutritionFacts.org As an endurance athlete I thought that beets/beet juice was my little secret but now you’ve let the cat out of the bag so to speak. I am curious if you had any comments on Dr. Ferenczi’s early Hungarian studies on the use of beets/beet juice to combat cancer? azwildcat76 / Originally posted in So Should We Drink Beet Juice Or Not? Answer : I see Dr. Ferenczi has published papers in both Hungarian and German . Anyone out there willing and able to translate them for me if I send you the PDFs? For an overview of my beet videos, see my blog yesterday at One Green Planet: Using Greens to Improve Athletic Performance . Image Credit: little blue hen / flickr
