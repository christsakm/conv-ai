Does “organic” chicken contain less arsenic  NutritionFacts.org Does “organic” chicken fare any better? Kristen / Originally posted in Dr. Oz, apple juice, and arsenic: chicken may have 10 times more Answer: Great question, Kristen! In a survey of arsenic levels in U.S. chicken, while nearly three-quarters of the breasts, thighs and livers from conventional producers carried detectable levels of arsenic, of certified organic or other “premium” chicken parts or whole chickens, just one-third had detectable arsenic. This suggests consumers who continue to eat chicken can lower their arsenic intake by choosing organic. Unfortunately, arsenic-laced chicken manure can still be used to grow organic produce (and rice! See How Much Arsenic In Rice Came From Chickens? ).
