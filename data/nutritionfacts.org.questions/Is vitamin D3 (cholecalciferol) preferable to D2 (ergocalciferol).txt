Is vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) preferable to D2 (ergocalciferol) I have read that D3 (cholecalciferol) is the better source of vitamin D. Can you please clarify? Jen Ferdinand / Originally asked in Vitamin Supplements Worth Taking Answer: Such a good question! Taken daily in doses under 2000 IU, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol) appear bioequivalent (meaning they both work just as well in your body). However if your physician suggests you take large intermittent doses (such as 50,000 IU weekly, then D3 is probably superior ). There’s so much new research out there that I’m working on a new video to specifically sift through all the evidence (read a recent systematic review here ).
