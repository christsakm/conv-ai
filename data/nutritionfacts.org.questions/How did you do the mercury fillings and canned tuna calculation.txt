How did you do the mercury fillings and canned tuna calculation How did you come up with your calculation about how many mercury-containing dental fillings are equivalent to eating a can of tuna once a week? vetstud / Originally posted in Amalgam Fillings vs. Canned Tuna Answer : Three national brands of canned tuna were recently tested for mercury . They averaged 600 ppb of mercury, exceeding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s safety level for human consumption (500 ppb). The drained solids in a can of tuna weigh about 170 grams , so that comes out to be about 100 mcg of mercury per can of tuna. A conservative estimate of the amount of mercury we’re exposed to on a daily basis per amalgam-filled tooth is 0.5 mcg , so eating a single can of tunafish a week is like having 29 teeth filled with mercury-based fillings day in and day out.
