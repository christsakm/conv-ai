Boric acid for vaginal yeast infections  NutritionFacts.org I have [had vaginal yeast infections] for years now (comes and goes). For almost a year I am vegan. My diet is nutrition dense, whole foods and no processed foods, but I still have vaginal discharges, sometimes very heavy. I rarely drink coffee. Please, do you have an information on this. LaGuna /Originally Posted in Bacterial Vaginosis and Diet Answer: In my practice I found the best cure for recurrent vaginal yeast infections is vaginal suppositories of boric acid. They are cheap (about 2 cents each ) and relatively safe . Though the mechanism is unclear , vaginal boric acid suppositories are effective in curing up to 98% of the patients who had previously failed to respond to the most commonly used antifungal drugs. DO NOT EAT BORIC ACID. Boric acid is toxic if taken orally (if swallowed). Keep away from children and open wounds. Boric Acid should also NOT be used when you are pregnant. To make your own suppositories, fill up large empty capsules with boric acid (like with the tip of a knife and a baggie). Insert one capsule into your vagina before bedtime every day for 2 weeks. You may want to wear a pad as it tends to be runny. It can also be helpful is to take some of the loose powder and spread it on your labia and under your clitoral hood. Stop the treatment if you experience burning or get a bloody discharge. Image credit: Ondřej Mangl / Wikimedia Commons
