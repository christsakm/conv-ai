Does wild rice contain the same levels of arsenic as brown rice I eat rice 2 or 3 times a week. When i go out to eat, I eat brown rice. When I make it at home, it is generally a wild rice blend. Does wild rice contain the same levels of arsenic? Rick / Originally posted on Arsenic in Rice Answer: Wild rice appears to have levels of arsenic comparable to regular rice, whether sourced from China , sold in the U.S. , or specifically from Wisconsin . For more on the arsenic and rice story, see my blog post How Much Arsenic In Rice Came From Chickens? , which references my video Arsenic in Chicken and prior post about Dr. Oz, Apple Juice, and Arsenic . Recently, Consumer Reports vindicated Dr. Ozâ€™s concerns about the unregulated levels of this toxic element in juice. Image Credit: Swanksalot / Flickr
