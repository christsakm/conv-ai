Are free-range eggs healthier than conventional eggs I have recently read that there is a difference between commercial eggs and farm eggs — I have six chickens that roam freely, and I use the eggs for cooking, for the occasional breakfast, and even for a dinner at least once a week. Am I wrong to think my eggs are healthier? cmcauliffe / Originally asked in Bad Egg Answer: That may be true of particularly pasture-raised hens, but a new study published this summer found no significant difference between cholesterol levels in “free-range” compared to conventional eggs (over 200mg per jumbo egg in each case). Free-range eggs are certainly better from an animal welfare standpoint, and also less likely to be contaminated with Salmonella (the leading cause of food-borne illness related hospitalization and death in the United States–see my video Total Recall ), but don’t appear to have less cholesterol, the most important health reason to minimize one’s egg intake (see for example my videos Egg Cholesterol in the Diet and Avoiding Cholesterol Is a No Brainer ).
