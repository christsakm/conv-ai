5 Tips for Storing Fresh Fruits and Vegetables - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>Fresh produce is part of a healthy eating plan and lifestyle.  Storing produce properly is important. We go to the store and buy delicious-looking food, but then we get home and end up storing it improperly, or we get busy and forget about it. Then we find our refrigerator having the aroma of overripe or rotting fruits and veggies. One way we can spend less and eat healthier is by storing our fresh food properly.</p>, <p>Many times we go to the market and see all the beautiful, fresh fruits and veggies in season and on sale, and we over buy. </p>, <p>I have a little product called an E.G.G. (Ethylene Gas Guardian, which is shaped like an egg), and it absorbs the ethylene. I just put it in my bin with the fruits and/or greens.  Of course, if you need something to ripen faster, then you can use this knowledge to your advantage. You can put the item you need to ripen with a fruit that gives off the high level of ethylene gas. I also use produce bags by Bio-Fresh and Evert-Fresh. They absorb ethylene gas and help your produce stay fresher longer.     </p>, <p><strong>These are high ethylene producers:</strong> apples, apricots, avocados, blueberries, cantaloupe, cherimoyas, cranberries, figs, green onions, guavas, grapes, honeydew, kiwifruit, mangoes, nectarines, papayas, passion fruit, peaches, pears, persimmons, plums, prunes, quince, and tomatoes. The banana is a high releaser, but should be stored in a cool dark place outside of the refrigerator.</p>, <p><strong>These are very sensitive to ethylene gas:</strong> asparagus, bananas (unripe), blackberries, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, chard, cucumbers, eggplant, endive, garlic, green beans, kale, leafy greens, leeks, lettuce, okra, onions, parsley, peas, peppers, raspberries, spinach, squash, strawberries, watercress, and watermelon. Keep them separate from the high ethylene gas producing foods.</p>, <p>With all the fresh fruits and vegetables enticing us from their bins at the farmersâ€™ market or grocery store, now we can make those delicious meals with our properly stored produce! </p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
