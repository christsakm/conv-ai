How The China Study Changed an Osteopath's Practice - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>I trained as an osteopath thirty-five years ago and joined with a doctor and other natural health therapists to establish the first Holistic Health Centre in the south of England. I also trained as a Buteyko Educator (breathing educator) fifteen years ago because I was convinced about the vital role breathing plays in health and disease. </p>, <p>Although I knew that diet was fundamental to our health, I could not bring myself to train in the field of nutrition because I saw the whole application of dietary practice as a “can of worms.” Every year, dietary recommendations seemed to change, depending on the latest fashion or the latest best selling weight loss book. </p>, <p>Finally, I found the research I had been looking for. <em><a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/the-china-study/">The China Study</a></em> offered a simple dietary concept that didn’t need multiple supplements, calorie counting, complex sequential eating of macronutrients, or a dietary adjustment according to blood type. It boiled down to eating all you want (while getting lots of variety) of any whole, unrefined plant-based foods. I was so impressed with the book’s message, I enrolled in the Center for Nutrition Studies <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/courses/plant-based-nutrition/">Plant-Based Nutrition Certificate</a> program powered by eCornell. I now offer dietary screening to all my patients using the <a href="http://4leafsurvey.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">4Leaf Survey</a> from J. Morris Hicks, former Board Member of the Center for Nutrition Studies and author of <em>Healthy Eating, Healthy World</em>. </p>, <p>With my structural osteopathic therapy, my breath training, and now the whole food, plant-based diet recommendations, I now offer a more effective, holistic health promoting service to my patients. A million thanks to Dr. T Colin Campbell, eCornell, and the Center for Nutrition Studies for giving me this great tool for achieving optimum health. The program was without a doubt the best educational course investment I’ve ever undertaken. </p>, <p>Now I look forward to the day that when a patient asks their doctor “Could my diet be the problem?” The doctor will offer to give them the 4Leaf Survey screening and some whole food, plant-diet recipes!</p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
