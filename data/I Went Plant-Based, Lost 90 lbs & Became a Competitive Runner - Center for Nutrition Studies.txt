I Went Plant-Based, Lost 90 lbs & Became a Competitive Runner - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>My husband, <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/400-lbs-ultrarunner/">Tim</a> had been on his plant-based journey for a few years. I had seen first-hand the lifesaving results from his new way of eating and daily habits. I fully supported him and I did eat more plant-based food, but for some reason, I never went fully plant-based. In 2014, I was diagnosed with a uterine fibroid that was bigger than a grapefruit. The fibroid was putting pressure on the ureter to my right kidney and had to be removed. </p>, <p>In 2015, I had a total hysterectomy. During the surgery and hospital stay, I had flashbacks to my mother’s long days and nights at the hospital as she battled leukemia. My dear mother lost her battle with cancer, and I vowed the day after my surgery that I would never set foot in a hospital again if I had anything to do with it. While I couldn’t control everything that happens to me, I could control what I put in my body. I flipped the switch, went 100 percent whole food, plant-based, and never looked back. As a result of making my health a priority, I have lost 90 pounds and become a competitive runner. I love running and being outside. The finish lines and medals are fun, but what I like most about it is spending time with my husband and enjoying the running community.</p>, <p>Now that Tim and I are both whole food, plant-based and active together our marriage is thriving. We feel like teenagers, and we are enjoying life to its fullest. We enjoy our new friends and our plant-based community. We are passionate about showing others how to transition to a whole food, plant-based lifestyle through our classes, social media, and potlucks.</p>, <p>I thank God for the second chance for both of us, and I am grateful for every day we are given. I can’t put into words how much I appreciate the plant-based doctors, educators, and community. It saved my husband’s life and gave us a completely new life together. I am convinced that without a whole food, plant-based lifestyle, I would not have my husband, and my children would not have their father.</p>, <p><img alt="I Went Plant-Based, Lost 85 lbs &amp; Became a Competitive Runner" src="https://cdn.nutritionstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/from-400-lbs-inside-2.jpg"/></p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
