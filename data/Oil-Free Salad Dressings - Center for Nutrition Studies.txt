Oil-Free Salad Dressings - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>People often say cheese is the hardest thing they had to give up when adopting a whole food, plant-based (WFPB) diet, but for me, it was oil. I had to be convinced that I could make food taste good without oil, and after much experimentation, I saw the light. The question then became, “How do you <em>replace</em> the oil?” Thankfully, there are many choices, and each has its pluses and minuses. </p>, <p>I have several salad dressing recipes that vary in their ingredients depending on the season and my mood. Variety makes my health journey easier, and having a dressing that I like gets me to eat more of nature’s best foods—vegetables. Here are some of my favorite ways to replace oil in most traditional salad dressing recipes.</p>, <p><img alt="Fresh Herb, White Bean Dressing" src="https://cdn.nutritionstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/oil-free-salad-dressings-2.jpg"/></p>, <p>From the upcoming cookbook <strong><em>Table For One</em></strong>, by Del Sroufe</p>, <p>I like this dressing on freshly steamed vegetables as much as I do on salad greens.
