Food Cravings and Healthier Plant-Based Alternatives - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>There is a reason we crave processed comfort foods high in fat, sugar, and salt, especially when feeling stressed, anxious, or tired. The taste of these foods provides us with immediate pleasure. But the blissful flavors of sugar, fat, and salt are short-lived. We are then left with uneven blood sugar levels, lack of energy, and unhappiness with ourselves. These negative physical and mental feelings often result in consuming <em>more</em> of these foods; thus, we find ourselves in a cycle of unhealthy food patterns:</p>, <p>Key to avoiding this unhealthful cycle is an awareness of your moods, emotions, and energy levels and the resulting food cravings. Begin noticing which foods you automatically reach for when feeling stressed or tired. Then, stop and consider whether you can substitute something else. A chart to get you started follows. Look at the list of commonly craved foods and corresponding plant-based alternatives. See which choices might work for you, then try it out. The goal is for you to stock up on foods that are healthful yet pleasurable to eat. Strive to develop a pattern that replaces unhealthy comfort foods with nourishing, tasty alternatives. You’ll be creating a cycle that boosts physical and emotional well-being:</p>, <p>Finally, be kind to yourself. Be committed to eating healthily, yet allow yourself to be imperfect. I often hear people remark, “I’ve been bad,” or, “I’ve fallen off the wagon.” There is no wagon to fall off on this journey. Remember: you are traveling on your individual path toward overall health and well-being.</p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
