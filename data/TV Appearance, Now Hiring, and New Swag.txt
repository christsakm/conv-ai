And slap our new stickers onto your laptop, water bottle, or bike.   From now until July 21, get 15% off all new merchandise (note: discount is automatically applied at checkout). See them all at DrGreger.org under Swag and Outreach. Fasting Webinar Next Week There’s one more day to register for my webinar on intermittent fasting on July 26th at 2pm ET. Registration ends July 19th midnight (ET). I’ll cover the pros and cons of calorie restriction and water-only fasting for weight loss, alternate-day fasting, body fat, longevity and metabolic health, the 5:2 diet, fasting-mimicking diets, and time-restricted feeding – and I will be answering questions live throughout. The focus for this webinar will be on weight control, but I am planning to do a second webinar in September on water-only and Buchinger modified fasting for other conditions such as blood pressure, autoimmune disease, and cancer.
