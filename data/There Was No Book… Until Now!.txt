 People are more likely to die during December and January than any other time of the year. Fitting, then, that my new book How Not to Die hits stores today! If you missed it yesterday, I created a video tour through the book, highlighting the differences between what’s in the book and what’s up on NutritionFacts.org. I wanted to write not just a reference book—one that compiles all the most compelling evidence in one place—but also a practical guide on translating the mountain of data into day-to-day decisions. That’s something that’s been partially missing from NutritionFacts.org, because I’ve wanted to just stick to the science. But I’ve always yearned to share so much more.
