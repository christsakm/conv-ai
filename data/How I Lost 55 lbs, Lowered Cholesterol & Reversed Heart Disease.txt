How I Lost 55 lbs, Lowered Cholesterol & Reversed Heart Disease [<p>My wife is a nurse and she encouraged me to have a cardiac computed tomography (CT) calcium scoring of my arteries. This was due to a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD). My score was shockingly high with extensive evidence of CAD. Rather than sinking into a mild depression I decided to do my own research. My internet research led me to purchase a copy of <em>The China Study</em> by T. Colin Campbell, PhD and Thomas M. Campbell, MD. I also read <em>Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease</em> by Caldwell B. Esselstyn, MD. Finally, I enrolled in the <a href="http://cdn.nutritionstudies.org/courses/plant-based-nutrition/" title="Plant-Based Nutrition Certificate">Plant-Based Nutrition Certificate</a> program through eCornell.</p>, <p>The information I received empowered me to take control of my life and make major dietary and lifestyle changes. I lost a total of 55 pounds. My BMI dropped from 30 to 23. My total cholesterol dropped 90 points without statins. I reached my ideal weight within three months. I have been on the whole food, plant-based (WFPB) diet since 2014. I have never looked back nor do I miss the Standard American Diet.</p>, <p>I am a pastor by vocation and dozens of people have heard and watched my story unfold. They have since embraced the plant-based lifestyle. I now teach a course challenging people to understand the disease process and its connection to the American Diet.</p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
