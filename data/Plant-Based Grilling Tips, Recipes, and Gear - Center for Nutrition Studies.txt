Check out these grilling essentials for healthy, plant-based cooking:</p>, <p><img alt="Plant-Based Grilling Tips, Recipes, and Gear" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/grill-1-2.jpg"/></p>, <p>Add fat-free chargrilled flavor to all of your veggies with a grill basket.  These are easy to use and easy to clean.</p>, <p><strong>How to Use a Grill Basket for Your Plant-Based Cooking:</strong></p>, <p><strong>Use for:</strong> Zucchini, mushrooms, onions, summer squash, bell peppers, asparagus.</p>, <p><strong>Keep it separate!</strong> These grill baskets also help keep the plant-based foods separate from the burgers. Essential if you’re cooking for a crowd of mixed eaters…because not everyone wants meat drippings on their veggies.</p>, <p><strong>Chef’s Tip:</strong>  You can also use these baskets for fruit. Add grilled flavor to peaches, plums, and even mangos by placing halved fruits into the basket and cooking over a medium-hot section of the grill. Toss with a teaspoon of vanilla extract or vegan cinnamon cashew cream just before serving. </p>, <p><img alt="Plant-Based Grilling Tips, Recipes, and Gear" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/grill-2.jpg"/></p>, <p><strong>Chef’s Tip:</strong> Grill zucchini and summer squash.

Ever lost a few hairs on your arm while reaching over the hot flames of the grill?  You need a set of heat-safe tongs and spatula.</p>, <p>These tongs are generally 14 inches, a bit longer than your regular indoor kitchen set.  The curved edge on the spatula makes it easy to maneuver around veggie burgers.  Heat-safe handles mean you won’t burn yourself if these sit too close to the flames…or too long in the sun.</p>, <p><strong>Chef’s Recipe</strong>: Grilled Potatoes With Marinade</p>, <p><strong>Korean “Bulgogi” Marinade:</strong></p>, <p><img alt="Plant-Based Grilling Tips, Recipes, and Gear" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/grill-5.jpg"/></p>, <p><strong>Chef’s Tip:</strong> Grill corn and asparagus then toss with mixed greens and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar for an easy, delicious vegan summer salad.</p>, <p><img alt="Plant-Based Grilling Tips, Recipes, and Gear" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/grill-6.jpg"/></p>, <p><strong>Chef’s Tip:</strong> Grill whole corn on the cob.
