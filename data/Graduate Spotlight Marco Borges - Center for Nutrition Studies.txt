At an early age, I realized that we need to move to be optimally healthy, and shortly thereafter it became crystal clear that food played a very important role. However, it was years of research that pointed me in the direction of a plant-based diet and thus began my fascination with the lifestyle and mission to share it with as many as possible.</p>, <p>The journey is quite simple if you see it as a beginning and not an end. What that means it that as you begin to lean towards plants, you realize that you’re empowering yourself with health and that it should be about progression, not perfection. The minute you see the journey as the end—of foods, snacks, fun, etc.—it becomes infinitely harder. Focus on what you’re gaining rather than what you’re giving up.</p>, <p>The <a href="http://cdn.nutritionstudies.org/courses/plant-based-nutrition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Plant-Based Nutrition Certificate</a> validated what I had been sharing with my family and friends for years, and it provided credibility for many who questioned the movement they now believe is the healthiest way to live and thrive.</p>, <p>The <a href="http://cdn.nutritionstudies.org/courses/plant-based-nutrition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Plant-Based Nutrition Certificate</a> is empowering many graduates with the tools they need to live their healthiest lives while sharing them with their family, friends, and community. This has created an elevated consciousness that inspires action and responsibility for the food we eat and where it comes from. </p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
