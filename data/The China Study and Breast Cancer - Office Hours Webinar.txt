The China Study and Breast Cancer - Office Hours Webinar [<p>The following video is a highlight from our October 2014 Campbellâ€™s Office Hours Webinar provided for <a href="/courses/plant-based-nutrition/" title="Courses">current and past students</a>. T. Colin Campbell, PhD, provides a background on breast cancer through reviewing the evidence of several studies, including <em><a href="/china-study/" title="The China Study">The China Study</a></em>, on the significance of breast cancer and diet.  Dr. Campbell concludes that none of these studies included a whole foods, plant-based diet and he stresses the importance of diet on breast cancer.  More research still needs to be done when it comes to dietary effects on breast cancer.</p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
