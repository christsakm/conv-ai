Plant Powered Eating for the Holidays - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>You have worked hard all year, eating a whole food plant-based diet, following a structured fitness plan, and reducing your stress levels to help you achieve or maintain a healthy body weight. Congratulations on an excellent job!</p>, <p>The true test of temptation always comes at the end of the year, during the holiday season. There are more “goodies” in the office, more parties to attend, more food-themed gifts, and all those traditional holiday desserts. Depending on which study you read, a person can gain anywhere from 1-10 pounds between Thanksgiving Day and New Year’s Day.</p>, <p>Since food is an important part of many celebrations and family traditions, it’s essential to have an Action Plan to avoid weight gain this holiday season.</p>, <p>Antioxidants and phytonutrients found in plant-based foods will also help to boost your body’s immune system. When you focus on eating to support your health, you automatically maintain your weight. Foods which support your health are nutrient dense and calorie poor. That means they are loaded with all the healthy nutrients, vitamins and minerals, your body needs, without extra calories. While at holiday parties, take only a “sample” or “bite” size of higher calorie foods.</p>, <p>During this holiday season focus on weight maintenance rather than weight loss. If you still have some pounds to lose, now is not the time to start a new weight loss plan or make any major dietary changes. Lastly, sign-up for some winter fitness events in your community or register for a January marathon somewhere warm and sunny.</p>, <p>Happy Holidays!</p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
