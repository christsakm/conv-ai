Can Nutrition Help Prevent Common Cold & Flu Viruses - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>Most respiratory tract infections (RTIs), including the common cold and flu (influenza) are caused by viruses. There are around 200 or more types and sub-types of virus that contribute. Further, viral DNA changes frequently. This makes preventing and treating RTIs quite difficult and helps explain why we tend to get many RTIs throughout our lives. Although we tend to think of a few days off work/school with a warm blanket, RTIs can be very serious, especially in those with a weakened immune system such as the elderly or those with certain medical conditions.</p>, <p>RTIs are usually spread through contact with others who are infected, for example from exposure to coughs, sneezes, and even breath. With this in mind, RTIs spread rapidly when people are in confined spaces: think of schools, large office blocks, public transportation, etc. Contaminated surfaces such as hands are major sources of transmission. For example, a person touching their nose, and then shaking your hand or touching a surface that you then touch with your own hand.</p>, <p>Therefore, one of the most important aspects to preventing RTIs is ensuring good hygiene practices, particularly regular hand washing. Of course, we don’t all wash our hands repeatedly everyday. Even if we practice good personal hygiene, it is unlikely that every individual we come into close proximity with does! This makes it almost impossible to avoid germs from others. Fortunately, there are other things that can influence our immune system—including a healthy diet—all of which can decrease RTI risk even when germs are all around us.</p>, <p><strong>Nutrition and Immune Function</strong></p>, <p>There is limited evidence regarding nutrition and RTIs specifically, but some of the available evidence is very interesting.</p>, <p>A study from the late 1980s reported that the total number of white blood cells did not differ between meat eaters and those following a plant-based diet. However, one very important type of immune cell (called natural killer cells) were more active in the plant-based group. This suggests increased protection against not only RTI, but also cancer<sup><a href="#cite-note-21">[21]</a></sup>. In fact, an earlier study from Australia reported that RTIs were lower in those eating a plant-based diet compared to meat eaters at every age group. Interestingly, RTI rates were higher in vegetarians than in those eating a high fruit and vegetable diet.<sup><a href="#cite-note-22">[22]</a></sup> This study suggests that eating a plant-based diet can be beneficial, but actually consuming fruits and vegetables as opposed to other plant-based foods may be optimal.</p>, <p>An interesting German study was published in the British Journal of Nutrition in 1999. The researchers recruited non-smoking, adult men and asked them not to eat many fruits or vegetables for two weeks. These men were then asked to consume tomato juice every day for 2 weeks, then carrot juice daily for another two weeks and finally dried spinach daily for 2 weeks. Immune function was decreased during the first two weeks of the study (i.e. low fruit &amp; vegetable). The other treatments, particularly tomato juice increased function significantly.<sup><a href="#cite-note-23">[23]</a></sup></p>, <p><strong>At-Risk Populations</strong></p>, <p>Certain sections of the population are at greater risk of severe RTI including infants, those with immune conditions, and the elderly. A fascinating study was completed by researchers in Northern Ireland and published in the nutrition journal, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. This study included a group of adults aged 65 years and older who had a low intake of fruit and vegetables (2 servings per day). These subjects were randomised to continue their normal diet or increase fruit and vegetable intake to 5 servings per day. After 12 weeks, vaccinations were administered. The antibody response in the 5 servings group was significantly higher than in the 2 servings group, indicating greater immune response in those eating more fruits and vegetables.<sup><a href="#cite-note-24">[24]</a></sup></p>, <p>Fruits and vegetables even seem to decrease infection risk in pregnancy. A 2010 study including over 1,000 pregnant women in Boston reported that those eating the most fruit and vegetables had 39% reduced RTI risk.<sup><a href="#cite-note-25">[25]</a></sup></p>, <p><strong>Nutrition and Influenza</strong></p>, <p>A large 2010 US study reported that a 5% increase in obesity or physical inactivity would lead to a 6% to 7% increase in flu hospitalizations. However, low fruit and veg intake would lead to an 8% increase in flu hospitalizations.<sup><a href="#cite-note-26">[26]</a></sup></p>, <p>So maybe an apple a day does keep the doctor away…well, a study published in the New York State Dental Journal reported that asking subjects to eat a single apple per day decreased RTIs by 16%!<sup><a href="#cite-note-27">[27]</a></sup></p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
