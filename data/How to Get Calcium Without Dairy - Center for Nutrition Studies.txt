How to Get Calcium Without Dairy - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>Because of some of the <a href="http://cdn.nutritionstudies.org/12-frightening-facts-milk/" title="12 Frightening Facts about Milk">evidence suggesting milk is unhealthy</a>, I suggest you skip the cowâ€™s milk. However this does not mean that calcium is unimportant. Calcium is vital for bone health. </p>, <p>Bone health is incredibly complex, involving many other nutrients like protein, phosphorus, vitamin D, and sodium and lifestyle factors like exercise. Government-recommended calcium intakes are controversial and could themselves be the topic of a huge, long discussion, but the bottom line, in my opinion, is that individuals should consume at least 500mg of calcium daily from a whole-foods, plant-based diet. </p>, <p>In one European study<sup><a href="#cite-note-1">[1]</a></sup>, vegans had a 30% higher risk of fracture compared to meat eaters, but they also had a significantly lower calcium intake than all the other groups. When researchers only considered vegans who ate at least 525mg of calcium a day, they found that vegans had no increased risk of fracture. In other words, the increased risk of fracture disappeared when consuming at least 525mg a day. </p>, <p>If you are eating a whole-food, plant-based diet, you can get over 500mg of calcium a day without thinking twice about it. Below is a chart showing the calcium content of a sample of many types of plants, with whole milk listed for comparison.</p>]
