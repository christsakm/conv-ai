Plant-Based Eating Program Benefits Nigerians Through Community Outreach - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p><em>The following is an article from a <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/community-grants/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Community Grant</a> recipient</em>.</p>, <p>My interest in nutrition was inspired by my experiences in the national youth service program, working with a woman in the northwestern part of my country who had lost her child to malnutrition, lack of nutrition therapy, and lack of basic nutrition literacy. These challenges are more important now than ever before. In the past, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) were thought to affect only the western countries of the world. Emerging evidence has shown that this is changing: according to the 2018 WHO country profile, NCDs account for an estimated 29% of all deaths in Nigeria, with cardiovascular diseases being the primary NCD, followed by cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes.</p>, <p>These diseases can be prevented by following a proper diet, and they are the reason that, as a young nutritionist, I decided to embark on projects that would create effective change in my community and country. One of the biggest inspirations for this decision was the T.
