Key Takeaways for Allergy Season and a Recipe for Taquitos  NutritionFacts.org It’s spring here in the United States, which, for millions of people, means allergy season. While you may be feeling lousy because your immune system is busily attacking allergens left and right, that same heightened state of alertness may have benefits for your overall health. Your immune system might be hard at work defending you against pollen and dust, but it could also be defending you against certain cancers. For more on that and on foods that can help reduce allergy symptoms, visit the allergies topic page .

Volunteer Spotlight: Jason Pooler I help create citations for the articles Dr. Greger uses in his videos. I love evidence-based medicine and am driven to help make sure that nutrition information is accurate and free of marketing hype. Dr. Greger’s stance on facts and information that is free of conflicts of interest inspires me to keep helping in any way I can. There are so many plant-based recipes I enjoy. One of my favorites is a tofu or edamame poke bowl because of how versatile they are. You can easily change the ingredients but still end up with a reliably delicious and filling meal. On top of that, they are super easy to batch cook and store for a quick grab-and-go lunch or dinner.
