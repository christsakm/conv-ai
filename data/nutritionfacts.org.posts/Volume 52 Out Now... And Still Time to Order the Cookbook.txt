Volume 52 Out Now... And Still Time to Order the Cookbook Thank you to everyone who made a donation for my birthday last month. It means the world to me! I’m very appreciative and humbled. My new cookbook will be out on Dec 8, just under a month from now! You can preorder your copy now and get it as soon as it lands, and get a sneak peek of some recipes on our Instagram . Did you know my best-selling books How Not to Die and How Not to Diet are available in dozens of languages? For international ordering information, go here . More on B12, Sorghum, and Plant-Based Meats in the New Volume My new volume, out today, is available as a streaming video so you can start watching the upcoming months of videos immediately. See the full list of topics here . All of these videos will eventually be available for free online on NutritionFacts.org, but they’re available now for those who don’t want to wait. And, remember, if you watch the videos on NutritionFacts.org or YouTube, you can access captions in several different languages. To find yours, click on the settings wheel on the lower-right corner of the video and then “Subtitles/CC.” If you are a $25+ monthly supporter and opted in to our donor rewards , you’d already be an expert on these new topics by now, having received an early, complimentary link to the new download. If you’d like to receive them before they’re available to the public, please consider becoming a monthly supporter.
