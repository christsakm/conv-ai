Job Opening at NutritionFacts.org  NutritionFacts.org Spanish Language Site We launched our Spanish language NutritionFacts.org and social media pages almost one year ago, and since then we have reached tens of thousands more people around the world. Now people can simply go to NutritionFacts.org/es and find our videos, transcripts, doctor’s notes, and other pages all en español. Video Caption Translations But that’s not the only way to see NutritionFacts.org in other languages. Over 80 volunteers spend time translating video captions into more than 16 languages. To find out if a video is translated into your language, hover over the video, click on the cog wheel, and select “subtitles.”  To become a translation volunteer, apply here . How Not to Die Book Translations When How Not to Die was published just over three years ago, I really had no idea if anyone would read it. I knew it could be an important way to get the research out beyond the NutritionFacts.org website, and I am thrilled that it has now been translated and distributed in 28 languages. #DailyDozenChallenge Going Strong People all over the world are completing the Daily Dozen Challenge and posting about it on YouTube and social media.  Have you taken the challenge?
