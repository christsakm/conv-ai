Get a 2017 Daily Dozen Recipe Calendar  NutritionFacts.org Today is #GivingTuesday, kicking off the charitable season with a celebration of giving and philanthropy. To commemorate it this year, we’ve created a 2017 Daily Dozen Recipe Calendar, with each month featuring a Green-Light recipe submitted by one of you! If your 2017 wall calendar doesn’t specify when National Kale Day is (October 5th, duh) then you have the wrong calendar! The first 150 people to donate $100 or more to keep the 501c3 nonprofit NutritionFacts.org alive and thriving will get a calendar in time for the new year. UPDATE: We are all out of calendars! Thank you so much for all your amazing support. Please check out our other donor rewards .
