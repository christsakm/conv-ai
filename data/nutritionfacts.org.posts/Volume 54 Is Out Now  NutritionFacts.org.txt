Volume 54 Is Out Now  NutritionFacts.org My new digital DVD, Volume 54, is out today and covers statins, SIBO, moringa, appetite, and more. It is available as a streaming video so you can start watching it immediately. Each video in this new collection will be released online over the next few months, available for free, but if you don’t want to wait, you can watch all of them by streaming right now . And, remember, if you watch the videos on NutritionFacts.org or YouTube , you can access captions in several different languages. To find yours, click on the settings wheel in the lower-right of the video and then “Subtitles/CC.” Happy viewing!
