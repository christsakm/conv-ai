Plant-Based Athletes, the Best Way to Cook Veggies, and More Last week, October 25, was my birthday. Thank you to everyone who donated to NutritionFacts.org, which I began as a labor of love dedicated to my grandma’s near miraculous recovery from heart disease thanks to lifestyle medicine pioneer Nathan Pritikin. That’s why I went into medicine, that’s why I started NutritionFacts.org, that’s why I wrote How Not to Die , and that’s why 100% of the proceeds I get from my books are all donated to charity. I just want to do for everyone’s family what Pritikin did for my family. If you still want to help celebrate my journey, you can make a tax-deductible donation to keep NutritionFacts.org exploding out into the world. New DVD covers plant-based athletes, the best way to cook veggies, and much more My new DVD is out today and is available as a streaming video so you can start watching it immediately. As you can see, there’s a variety of topics covered, from eggs and breast cancer, “vitamin B17,” light vs. dark roast coffee, and the best foods for bad breath. All of these videos will be rolling out for free online starting at the end of November, but if you don’t want to wait, you can watch them all streaming right now . Here’s the full list of chapters from the new volume—a preview of what’s to come over the next few months on NutritionFacts.org:
