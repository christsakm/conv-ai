Top 10 Most Popular Videos of 2017  NutritionFacts.org Thanks to the collective enthusiasm for sharing NutritionFacts.org by our subscribers , Twitter and Instagram followers, and 1.5 million Facebook and G+ fans, we averaged millions of video views a month this year. But it’s not about the numbers; it’s about the people whose lives we’ve touched, changed, or even saved. That is why I’ve dedicated my life to get new videos and articles up each and every day. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who has made this public service possible. NutritionFacts.org arises from my annual review of the medical literature. With the help of a team of hundreds of volunteers, we churned through tens of thousands of papers published in the peer-reviewed scientific nutrition literature and are ramping up to break new records in 2018. How do I choose which studies to highlight? In general, I strive to focus on the most groundbreaking, interesting, and useful findings; but which topics resonate the most? Is it the practical ones, offering cooking or shopping tips? Or those that dissect the studies behind the headlines? Maybe it’s the geeky science ones exploring the wonderfully weird world of human biology? As you can see from the below list, the answer seems to be a bit of all of the above: #10 Are Avocados Healthy? Actually, all the avocado videos were really popular this year. Also check out The Effects of Avocados and Red Wine on Meal-Induced Inflammation , Are Avocados Good for Your Cholesterol? , and Avocados Lower Small Dense LDL Cholesterol . #9 What Does a Low White Blood Cell Count Mean? I figured this would be popular since it was a popular question I get, followed by What Is the Ideal White Blood Cell Count? #8 Best Foods to Counter the Effects of Air Pollution The picture kind of gives it away :). This was one of many popular Best Food for X videos this year, including Best Foods to Reduce Stroke Risk , Best Supplements for Prostate Cancer , The Best Food for High Cholesterol , Best Foods for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) , and Best Foods to Improve Sexual Function . #7 Dr. Gundry’s The Plant Paradox is Wrong This was such a popular video it tempts me to do more analyses of the popular press.
