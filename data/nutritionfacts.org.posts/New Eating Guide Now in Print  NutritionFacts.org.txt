New Eating Guide Now in Print  NutritionFacts.org In January we launched the Evidence-Based Eating Guide, which is available for free download here . Today I’m excited to announce that you can now order hard copies of the guide at-cost over on DrGreger.org . The guide is a run-down of my practical tips in booklet form, including summaries of my Traffic Light system and Daily Dozen checklist, as well as tips for putting them into practice. As a current subscriber, you can also download digital PDFs: here’s an online version , and a fewer-page printable version (best when printed single-sided). Now that there are physical copies, hopefully you’ll see stacks in a doctor’s office near you! More Ways to Donate You can support NutritionFacts.org with Amazon Smile.
