But, if you want to see them all at once, you can get the digital download FREE for a limited time. Download the videos here . If you haven’t seen it yet, we’ve put up a resource page all about COVID-19 with videos, links to my pandemic blog post and special Q&A sessions, my DIY hand sanitizer recipes, and more. Check it out here . I’ve also continued to do a bunch of interviews, with Dr. Neal Barnard of PCRM, and Rich Roll . Last Day to Register for B12 Webinar My next webinar on my latest vitamin B12 recommendations is happening June 26 at 2pm ET, and registration closes tomorrow, June 19. I’ll start out with a discussion of the symptoms of B12 deficiency and then explain how I arrived at what I consider the optimal dose of vitamin B12 supplements in children, adults, the elderly, and during pregnancy. I’ll clarify why cyanocobalamin ( not methylcobalamin) is the best type of vitamin B12 supplement and address the data suggesting B12 supplements cause acne, bone fractures, and lung cancer. I’ll also cover the healthiest food sources of B12 for those who don’t want to take supplements. And of course, I’ll be answering your questions during the Q&A portion. I hope you’ll join me! Update: Thank you to everyone who attended the webinar. The digital download of the videos from the webinar is now available on DrGreger.org . Saying Farewell to Physical DVDs
