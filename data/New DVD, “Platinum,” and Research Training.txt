 My new DVD came out last week and is available as streaming video so you can start watching it immediately. In this new volume, I have videos on practical tips to improve brain function, cramps, and asthma; not to mention a video entitled Best Foods to Improve Sexual Function. I cover avocados, red wine, flax versus chia, and the breast cancer risk associated with applying aluminum-containing antiperspirants to shaved underarms.
