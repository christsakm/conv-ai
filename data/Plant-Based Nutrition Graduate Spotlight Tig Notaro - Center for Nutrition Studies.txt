Plant-Based Nutrition Graduate Spotlight Tig Notaro - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>Graduates of the <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/courses/plant-based-nutrition/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plant-Based Nutrition Certificate</a> demonstrate not only a wide range of backgrounds, but also an exciting breadth of potential. Their numerous and unique post-certificate achievements speak for themselves. We are proud to share their journeys and recognize the growth they exemplify, both as individuals and as reflections of a larger community.</p>, <p>Congratulations to <a href="https://tignation.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tig Notaro</a> on being chosen as our <em>Graduate of the Month</em>.</p>, <p>Over the years, there were several stretches of time during which I was drawn to the idea of being healthier and “eating right.” I’d have a salad and think to myself, <em>this is delicious, I should eat more salad</em>. So, I would eat more salad, and that would last for a few weeks. But like almost every other American, I would soon end up eating burgers again. Why? Because my desire to eat better was never grounded in anything substantial. I always had the vague idea that I needed to eat better, and that once I did, everything would click into place, but I didn’t even know what “eating right” was supposed to look like. Sure—I could commit to having more salad, but what did that even mean? <em>Why</em> should I have more salad? Fundamentally, I had no real knowledge about nutrients or the healing benefits of certain foods. I seemed slated to float in and out of these patterned behaviors: wanting to eat better, trying to eat better, and eventually reverting.</p>, <p>It wasn’t until I simultaneously contracted pneumonia, the intestinal disease C. diff, and invasive cancer that I was able to really focus my attention and passion on eating better. I was recovering from these three deadly illnesses when I started to really understand and respect just how toxic the wrong foods can be, and just how medicinal the right foods can be. I was also beginning to search for solutions to my ongoing pain and illness beyond conventional Western medicine. Not because I was anti-doctor or anti-Western medicine (I’ve certainly needed both, at times), but because I was struggling despite that medicine. I had seen friends benefit from a shift to a <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/whole-food-plant-based-diet-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plant-based diet</a>, including some who were recovering from <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/topics/disease/?tag=cancer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancer</a>, and I’d reached a point of being really tired of my daily pain and suffering. I figured I’d dip my foot into eating plant-based. <em>Worst case scenario</em>, I told myself, <em>I’ll eat healthily for a few weeks</em>.</p>, <p>Within the first week of my plant-based diet, there was a noticeable alleviation of my pain and <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/t/inflammation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inflammation</a>. I also felt more in touch with my body. My head was clearer, and I felt less weighed down. The switch was easy for me because it was grounded in experience: just as I could feel the very sudden loss of health and wellbeing, I could feel a noticeable shift toward better health and wellbeing soon after I changed my diet. I wasn’t just reading or hearing about the life-and-death stakes of dietary choice, I was feeling it.</p>, <p>Within that first week, I called my wife, Stephanie, and told her I’d been eating plant-based while on tour and that I felt confident it was helping me and made sense for my healing process. She’d been a vegetarian since she was a teenager, and she immediately said she’d <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/benefits-social-support-healthy-lifestyle/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">love to do it as well</a>. We made the decision to also introduce our <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/why-parents-should-keep-children-meat-and-dairy-free/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one-year-old children</a> to a plant-based diet, and we’ve all been that way ever since.</p>, <p>During the downtime of the pandemic, I had my first real time off from stand-up comedy, and it allowed me to fantasize about things I wouldn’t ordinarily think I could do. One day during lockdown, I was reading a book about nutrition and turned to Stephanie and said, “I wonder what it would take for me to get some sort of certification in this.”</p>, <p>By this point, I’d been eating plant-based for years and had been feeling so much better. I found myself wanting to talk to others about my diet, but I didn’t want to come across like I was swept up in some fad. I wanted to have specific knowledge about why I was feeling better. I also wanted to help others transition to a plant-based diet, but I felt I needed to make sure I had the correct information to offer. Instead of generically saying, “I feel good, and you should too,” I wanted to say, “I feel good, and here’s why.”</p>, <p>I had discovered <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/about/dr-t-colin-campbell/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">T. Colin Campbell’s</a> articles and listened to him in interviews, and I found nothing faddish about him. His research and knowledge were very compelling, so I enrolled in the <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/courses/plant-based-nutrition/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plant-Based Nutrition Certificate program</a>. At first, my goal was simply to educate myself, but I came to realize that I wanted to do something bigger with the certificate. I wanted to make these discussions I have about my plant-based diet bigger and more real than just with friends, family, neighbors, and fellow comedians. After witnessing <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/topics/success-stories/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">numerous people</a> who made a change toward a plant-based diet and saw positive results from their condition, or a complete reversal of their condition, such as I experienced, I started to feel compelled to help people on a larger, more official level. Hearing so many people’s concerns or complaints about their health and wellbeing, and knowing that there was a direct path to potentially fixing or easing these health challenges, I felt a responsibility to do something.</p>, <p><img alt="Graduate Spotlight: Tig Notaro" src="https://cdn.nutritionstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/graduate-spotlight-tig-notaro-2.jpg"/></p>, <p>Armed with the knowledge I gained from the <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/courses/plant-based-nutrition/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plant-Based Nutrition Certificate program</a> and with my continual research, I’m beginning to take real steps toward putting myself out there—to guide others who are trying to become plant-based, and to support those who are trying to maintain a plant-based diet. As of now, Firmly Planted with Tig Notaro will consist of live or live-streaming events (maybe consulting and/or podcasting down the road) for those wanting to learn and discuss how to successfully become plant-based, as well as for those who are already plant-based and want to be part of a larger community and discussion. Selfishly, I’m also doing this to engage more fully in my passion for plant-based living and eating.</p>, <p>It’s very important to understand what draws you to a plant-based diet. Find and connect to a firm belief that this is the diet for you. There are various reasons why it might be. Is it animal rights? Your health? The health of your <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/topics/family/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">family</a>? The <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/topics/environment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">environment</a>? If you aren’t passionate or grounded, nothing will keep you rooted here.</p>, <p>Earning my <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/courses/plant-based-nutrition/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plant-Based Nutrition Certificate</a> gave me a much broader understanding of my diet. That knowledge, in turn, keeps me more connected to the way I eat and live. The program’s information was streamlined and easy to follow, and I appreciated Dr. Campbell’s straightforward, matter-of-fact manner of sharing his knowledge. As someone with a very unpredictable schedule, it was great to be able to go at my own pace. Finishing the program and having a sense of completion in an area I’m passionate about is also truly a great feeling.</p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
