Newly Released USDA Dietary Guidelines Miss the Mark [<p>Last April, 2015, I wrote <a href="http://cdn.nutritionstudies.org/2015-dietary-guidelines-commentary/">my thoughts on the USDA Dietary Guidelines</a> advisory committee report that awaited the response from the USDA Secretary’s office—just released.</p>, <p>My comments were published in a congressional blog and on this website.</p>, <p>I was once a supporter of the USDA report, however I am now convinced that this has become nothing more than a political football. The record speaks for itself. The advisory committee must walk on eggshells and when they hint of something scientifically new, it makes little difference. </p>, <p>It is only perpetuation of a defunct process!</p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
