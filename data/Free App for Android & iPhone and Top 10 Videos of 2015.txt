 The second half of my new book (and New York Times Bestseller for the third week in a row—I’m still pinching myself!), How Not to Die, revolves around my Daily Dozen, a checklist of all the things I try to fit into my daily routine. The more I’ve researched over the years, the more I’ve come to realize that healthy foods are not necessary interchangeable. While some nutrients, such as vitamin C, are found throughout the plant kingdom, other beneficial compounds are found concentrated in certain foods, like the anti-cancer lignans in flaxseeds or the sulforaphane in cruciferous vegetables. So if we don’t eat them every day we’re going to miss out.
