How I Lost Weight & Reversed Diabetes With Diet [<p>I was overweight and had serious vision problems with recurring infections. When I went to my doctor, he measured my glucose levels and found it to be 279. He told me I was diabetic and I would have to take medication starting that very same day and for the rest of my life to control my glucose levels. He told me I had bad genes since two of my older sisters had the same disease.</p>, <p>I refused to accept such a diagnosis and went home to do research about diabetes (I knew very little about it). I began a whole food, plant-based (WFPB) diet after I found books by authors such as Dr. T. Colin Campbell, Dr. Neal Barnard, and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn. They all had similar messages which made my decision grow stronger even against some outsiders’ opposition to my “radicalism.”</p>, <p>Within three months of eating a WFPB diet and without taking any medications, my glucose levels returned to a normal range. Most of my family members were impressed with my results and they were excited about all the new and interesting foods I was preparing. They decided to join me on my journey. My husband lost 30 pounds and returned to his ideal weight. Even though he did not have any diagnosis of chronic disease he felt much healthier than before. With eating this way we do not take any medications and have not been sick since 2010, not even the flu or a headache. We feel great!</p>, <p>After graduating from the <a href="http://cdn.nutritionstudies.org/courses/plant-based-nutrition/" title="Plant-Based Nutrition Certificate">Plant-Based Nutrition Certificate</a> through the T. Colin Campbell Center for Nutrition Studies I am now working on a culinary certificate. I hope to publicly speak to people about this new and healthy way of eating. I am excited and feel privileged to participate in the growing plant-based movement.</p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
