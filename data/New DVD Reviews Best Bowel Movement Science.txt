 Of all human bodily functions, defecation has been described as perhaps the least studied and the least understood. Elimination doesnâ€™t just remove wastes from the body, but may play a vital role in hormonal, cholesterol, and bile acid regulation. Some have even advocated for bowel habits to be considered a vital sign, right alongside pulse rate and blood pressure. I review the latest science in five new videos, including How Many Bowel Movements Should You Have Every Day? and Should You Sit, Squat, or Lean During a Bowel Movement? They are available right now as a video download as part of my new Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 25 (all proceeds go to this charity). It can also be ordered as a physical DVD.
