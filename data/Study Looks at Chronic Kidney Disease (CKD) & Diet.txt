Study Looks at Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) & Diet [<p>People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who eat a greater ratio of plant to animal protein live longer, according to a recent study<sup><a href="#cite-note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>. CKD is largely a disease of unhealthy aging in America, like dementia, cataracts, and osteoporosis. And it is extremely common. About a third of all Americans over the age of 60 have chronic kidney disease. Unfortunately, most are not aware that their kidneys are failing.</p>, <p>The recent study found that those with at least stage 3 (out of 5) chronic kidney disease who consumed more plant-based diets had a reduced risk of death. Those with the highest ratio of plant to animal protein intake compared to the lowest had a 33% reduced risk of dying over the next 8 and a half years. </p>, <p>Those with stage 4 or stage 5 CKD may need to be mindful of their potassium intake, but this new study adds to a deep fund of knowledge that a plant-based, low-animal protein diet is good for the kidneys. Given how common is the problem of kidney disease, this is an important message for all Americans. </p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
