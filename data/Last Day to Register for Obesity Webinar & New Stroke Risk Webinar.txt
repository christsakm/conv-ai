 I’m excited to announce my next webinar, taking place on February 19:  Why Do Vegetarians Have Higher Stroke Risk? Unlike the obesity webinar, which was put together mostly just to satisfy the intellectual curiosity of fellow nutrition nerds (more info below!), my February webinar is going to be of a more practical nature. Given that high blood pressure and inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption are among the most important stroke risk factors, you would assume those eating plant-based diets would be at significantly lower risk, just as they are with heart attacks. You might be surprised to learn that there had never been any studies on the incidence of stroke in vegetarians, though…until now. And if you think that is surprising, wait until you hear the results. Yes, they had lower heart disease risk as expected, but those eating meat-free diets appeared to have more stroke risk. If that is indeed the case, what might be the cause, and what can we do about it? I hope you’ll join me for this important event. For more information and to register, go here. Date and Time: February 19, 2-4pm ET Last Day to Register: February 13   Today is the last day to register for my next webinar on January 24 at 2pm ET: What Triggered the Obesity Epidemic?
