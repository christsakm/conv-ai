7-Day Immune System Boost - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p><strong>Join our 7-day immune system boost! Every day for a week, check out our key tips, recipes, and resources to help strengthen your immune system and stay healthy. Taking a proactive approach is not only important during our current pandemic circumstances, but it can be protective all year round.</strong></p>, <p>Leafy greens are filled with fiber, along with crucial vitamins, minerals, and plant-based phytochemicals. These biologically active compounds detoxify the body by neutralizing free radicals, inhibiting enzymes that activate carcinogens, and boosting immunity. According to research, the consumption of cruciferous greens may control the activity of vital immune cells through the activation of a gene known as T-bet. This gene instructs precursor cells to develop innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), which play a vital role in protecting the body from infection.</p>, <p><strong>Article to Read:</strong> </p>, <p><a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/take-back-your-power-immunity-boosting-foods-and-tips/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://cdn.nutritionstudies.org/take-back-your-power-immunity-boosting-foods-and-tips/</a></p>, <p><strong>Recipe to Try:</strong> </p>, <p><a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/recipes/sides/easy-balsamic-potato-salad/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://cdn.nutritionstudies.org/recipes/sides/easy-balsamic-potato-salad/</a></p>, <p><strong>Video to Watch:</strong> </p>, <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNUxkffqqs4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNUxkffqqs4</a></p>, <p><strong>Meme to Share:</strong> </p>, <p><img alt="7- Day Immune Boosting Challenge" src="https://cdn.nutritionstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/day-1.jpg"/></p>, <p style="height: 20px;">
<h3>Day 2: Eat Nutrient Dense, High-Antioxidant Foods</h3>
<p>Diets centered around whole, plant-based foods appear to stimulate natural killer cell activity. Natural killer cells are part of the innate immune response that hones in on pathogens, including viruses and tumors. Include plenty of bright and colorful fruits and vegetables in your diet. Vibrant colors signal the presence of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phytochemicals like carotenes, polyphenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanidins. Mushrooms are superstars when it comes to boosting immunity! They contain selenium, vitamin D, antioxidants, and polysaccharides that help regulate immunity and reduce inflammation.</p>

<p style="height: 20px;">
<h3>Day 3: Eat Less Fat — Focus on Healthy Fats</h3>
<p>Diets high in unhealthy fats impair immunity by decreasing the function of T-cells. Fried foods and those containing oil promote inflammation and hinder appropriate immune responses. Research has shown a link between reduced-fat diets (20 percent of calories) and the increased activity of natural killer cells, an important component of the immune system’s response. On the other hand, a moderate consumption of healthy fats, such as those found in nuts and seeds, aids in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, and E, which are crucial for immune health. Brazil nuts and sunflower seeds are a good source of selenium, a key player in immune health. Pumpkin seeds provide magnesium and zinc, which work to strengthen your immune system. Omega-3 fats found in flax seeds, chia seeds, and walnuts help to tame systemic inflammation and free your immune system to defend against pathogens. </p>

<p style="height: 20px;">
<h3>Day 4: Eat High-Fiber Foods</h3>
<p>Whole grains and legumes provide fiber for a healthy gut. Since the gut is a major center of immune activity, it’s important to keep it balanced! These foods also contain B vitamins and zinc for added immune support. The fiber in oats activates natural killer cells due to their high B-glucan content. </p>

<p style="height: 20px;">
<h3>Day 5: Use Spices and Teas</h3>
<p>The medicinal properties of herbs, spices, and teas have been explored by civilizations for thousands of years. Herbs and spices have high levels of antioxidants, and when used in combination, the bioavailability of some of the compounds they contain are boosted, maximizing their benefit. </p>
<p><strong>Turmeric</strong> is a powerful ancient spice that gets its vibrant color from curcumin, a potent anti-inflammatory compound. It can be used to give recipes a beautiful golden color or used to make tea. </p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong> possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties and contains a phytochemical known as sesquiterpenes that may target colds and viruses.  </p>
<p><strong>Garlic</strong> has been shown to increase antioxidant enzymes in humans and potentially has an effect in helping to clear bacteria from the lungs. </p>
<p><strong>Green and hibiscus tea</strong> both rank very high in their antioxidant content. Drink them hot or cold, alone or together with other herbs and spices such as mint and/or ginger for a nutrition punch.</p>

<h3>Day 6: Move More</h3>
<p>The best way to stay healthy is to keep your immune system strong. Epidemiological evidence indicates that regular moderate physical activity reduces the incidence of viral and bacterial infections. Acute exercise stimulates the interchange of innate immune system cells and components between lymphoid tissues and the bloodstream. The immune system is based on the constant creation and death of cells. When we keep these cells in a steady state of health, we can take charge and defend our bodies to the best of our ability.</p>

<h3>Day 7: Practice Healthy Lifestyle Choices</h3>
<p>Provide the best environment for the body to heal itself! Our immune system is extraordinarily capable and complex. The more we learn how our body works, the better prepared we are to make good choices to enhance the quantity and quality of our lives. A healthy diet provides the necessary fuel to nourish our body, but there are other key players in a lifestyle that sets the stage for optimal immune function. These include engaging in regular aerobic activity, getting adequate rest and sleep, managing stress, getting enough sunshine, staying hydrated, and engaging in healthy social relationships. </p>
