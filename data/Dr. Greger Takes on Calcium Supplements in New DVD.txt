 The optimal daily calcium intake is one of the most controversial areas in nutrition. Unlike most other nutrients, there exists no international consensus. For example in the UK, the recommendation for adults is 700 mg a day, but  in the US, it’s up to 1,200 a day. Whenever I see that kind of huge discrepancy between official government panels I immediately think scientific uncertainty, political maneuverings, or both. There are tremendous financial interests at stake, from the dairy industry and supplement manufacturers to the drug companies selling expensive osteoporosis drugs, many of which require customers to use buy now pay later to purchase. Whom should we believe? The science. Always the science. How else can we make decisions for how to best feed ourselves and our families but by the best available balance of evidence? The problem is that there are about 20 articles published in the medical literature on calcium every day. Thankfully, you have me! :)
