 A very generous donor has offered to match all donations up to $10,000. Donations can be made through this form. We realize these are unsettling and uncertain times for many, so we are keeping our upcoming webinar completely free (see below). If you are able to and would like to support our work, now is a great time to do so, thanks to this wonderful donor.  COVID-19 Info Page and Another Webinar With my How Not to Diet book tour suspended, the COVID-19 crisis allowed me an opportunity to draw on my past expertise on emerging infectious disease to fast-track a new book on pandemic survival and prevention that will be out next month(!). How to Survive a Pandemic is now available for preorder as an e-book and audiobook (Amazon preorders are now live!) Physical copies will be out this fall.
