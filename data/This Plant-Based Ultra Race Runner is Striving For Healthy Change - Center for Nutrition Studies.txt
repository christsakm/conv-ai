This Plant-Based Ultra Race Runner is Striving For Healthy Change - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>Vegan? That was the last designation I ever thought I would use for myself. I mean, how the heck could I?</p>, <p>My former self was an aggregation of beer drinking guy, pack a day smoking dude, and tattooed heavy metal band singing badass! Plant eater? Yeah right! I mean those people were just hippies that ate grass right? Plus, vegans were those crazy people always protesting with signs and screaming at people; who the heck wants to become part of that?</p>, <p>Rewind to 6-7 years ago when I finally got around to seeing a doctor. I was getting close to 40 and it was time to check-in even though I felt as healthy as ever. I had insurance so why not use it? After giving blood the week before, I saw the doctor and was told I had the cholesterol of a man larger than myself and older. I couldn’t believe it. The immediate thought was to put me on some pill and see what happened from there. Maybe we could get this under control and I wouldn’t be at risk for a heart attack before 50!</p>, <p>I had other ideas though.</p>, <p>I never was much of a pill guy. There had to be a way to do this without becoming part of the pharma machine. I started doing some research; reading this article and watching that documentary. Like so many others I was blown away by <em>Forks Over Knives</em>. I followed that up with <em>Vegucated</em>, <em>Food Inc</em> and many more. The truth started becoming more and more obvious, I could fix my cholesterol issues if I cut out meat. Sounded simple enough.</p>, <p>So I did that and started running and exercising too. It just felt like the obvious thing to do, right? The next year my numbers didn’t really seem to change much. I was getting healthier and could run a Spartan Race with no issues, but my cholesterol was still high and I was at risk. So I cut out dairy. I also had to find a new doctor as mine was retiring. I wanted to make sure I found the right one though and they had to fit in with this new lifestyle I was obsessed with.</p>, <p>Enter <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/author/ksidhartha/">Dr. Kumara Sidhartha</a>. After another year, and dropping the dairy, I went to see him for my first physical. Let’s compare what he saw compared to my last test results.</p>, <p><img alt="This Plant-Based Ultra Race Runner is Striving For Healthy Change" src="https://cdn.nutritionstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/runner-striving-for-healthy-change-2.jpg"/></p>, <p>Were those numbers perfect? No but the real question is, were they better?! Heck yes they were. This lit a fire in me like nothing else. I started feeling better and better. My recovery time from over-exerting myself with exercise and endurance events was getting smaller and smaller. I could push myself more and more; which I did.</p>, <p>In 2015 I competed in the Winter Death Race in Pittsfield, VT. I made it to the 20 hour mark and took the DNF (did not finish), but it still felt like I accomplished something. Those 20 hours were grueling and my body had enough abuse. I made peace with my decision and was okay with it. I had spent all that time doing remedial tasks all the while dealing with temperatures below -20° F.</p>, <p>Yes, you read that right!</p>, <p>That same year, at the end of the summer, I finished my first ultra-marathon. It took me a lot longer than I hoped but I finished and checked that off the bucket list. It was a rigorous race, but where I failed I learned what not to do.</p>, <p>Eating plants and plant-based foods sets me up for success everyday. Whether it’s running a 5k, 10k or a Ragnar Relay with the Strong Hearts Vegan Power team the fact of the matter is, I would never have been able to do it living the life I used to live.</p>, <p>I’m currently training for my next 50k in June, the <a href="http://veganpowerultra.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vegan Power Ultra</a> and have set a goal to run from one end of Cape Cod to the other. That is roughly 62 miles and will be my first 100k distance. Why? To say I did because I can! Also because I turn 45 this year so I want to prove that plants can power anyone, at any age, to accomplish things they never thought they could.</p>, <p>I’m far from Scott Jurek or Catra Corbett. I’m not winning races anytime soon. I’m just an average guy with a job I enjoy, a family I adore and an obsession eating plants, fighting for animals and running some trails while I’m at it.</p>, <p>I am vegan yet I’m not infallible. Striving for change is all we can do, perfection will come. I have work to do and I eat junk from time to time, but staying away from animal based products as a whole has benefited me physically and mentally. My cholesterol has dropped a bit more and I still struggle getting it where I want, but I’ve done so with food and not pharmaceuticals.</p>, <p>I may be 44 but I’m just finding out that age doesn’t matter when you treat your body well. My best years are ahead of me and I’m not looking back!</p>, <p><em>Image credit: Ben Kimball photographed the image of Nate running in the woods.</em></p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
