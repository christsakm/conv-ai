12 Questions Answered Regarding Vitamin B12 - Nutrition Vitamin B12 is one of the most common topics I get asked about for those interested in a plant-based diet. I think we have a natural tendency to make sure we are getting enough of everything, and vitamin B12 is a legitimate concern for exclusively plant-based eaters, so it causes a fair amount of anxiety.Because of this, I spent some time reviewing literature regarding B12 when I was writing my book The Campbell Plan , in which I discuss B12, other supplements, and many other hot topics as people transition to a plant-based diet.
