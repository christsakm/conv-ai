How to Get Calcium Without Dairy - Center for Nutrition Studies Because of some of the evidence suggesting milk is unhealthy , I suggest you skip the cowâ€™s milk. However this does not mean that calcium is unimportant. Calcium is vital for bone health.Bone health is incredibly complex, involving many other nutrients like protein, phosphorus, vitamin D, and sodium and lifestyle factors like exercise. Government-recommended calcium intakes are controversial and could themselves be the topic of a huge, long discussion, but the bottom line, in my opinion, is that individuals should consume at least 500mg of calcium daily from a whole-foods, plant-based diet.In one European study [1] , vegans had a 30% higher risk of fracture compared to meat eaters, but they also had a significantly lower calcium intake than all the other groups. When researchers only considered vegans who ate at least 525mg of calcium a day, they found that vegans had no increased risk of fracture. In other words, the increased risk of fracture disappeared when consuming at least 525mg a day.If you are eating a whole-food, plant-based diet, you can get over 500mg of calcium a day without thinking twice about it. Below is a chart showing the calcium content of a sample of many types of plants, with whole milk listed for comparison.
