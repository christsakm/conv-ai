Chef Del’s Secrets to Designing the Best Plant-Based Bowls Ever - Center for Nutrition Studies When I first moved out of my Mom’s house and into my own apartment, I ate more bowls than sit-down meals served on plates. Call it a lazy attempt to avoid doing dishes, or call it inspiration from my great-grandfather Harry who ate his breakfast in a bowl every day. My grandmother tried to put his food on a plate, but he would scrape it all into a bowl and eat it that way. I think I inherited a little of his rebellious nature.Nowadays, bowls served at restaurants have a prescribed structure. They typically start with some sort of base—something like rice, quinoa, or pasta—and that is followed by any number of toppings, including steamed vegetables, baked tofu, jackfruit, pickled onions, or stir fry. Finally, the bowl is finished with a sauce and garnishes. The menus are usually set up so you can design your own bowl any way you want. In my hometown, there are restaurants that make nothing but bowls, and I have ordered a few, but every time I do, I think to myself, I can make this better at home.When I do make a bowl at home, I either start with leftovers from the fridge, or a theme like Thai, Mexican, Italian, or Southern Comfort. Next, I decide what base I want to use. Rice is the most common base I use because I make a pot of rice once a week to have on hand for any number of dishes I make throughout the week. Quinoa, millet, and bulgur are my other favorite bases for bowls.
