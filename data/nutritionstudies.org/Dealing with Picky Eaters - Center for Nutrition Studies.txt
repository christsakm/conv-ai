Dealing with Picky Eaters - Center for Nutrition Studies Fact of life: Kids can be picky. But this shouldn’t deter you from making healthy diet changes for your family! Here are a few tips for dealing with your picky eaters:Bonus Tip: Here is a fun activity for getting your children to try new foods! Make a “Muffin Tin Meal”: Find a muffin tin and place a different food in each individual muffin spot. Encourage your child to at least try a bite from each spot. (Use positive instead of negative words. For example, say “After you try it, you can have some more or wait until another time” instead of “At least try it before deciding that you don’t like it.”) You can put stickers at the bottom of each spot to make things more fun. And if you want, you can turn the activity into a fun game, with prizes (non-food-related) for trying new foods!Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies. All rights reserved.
