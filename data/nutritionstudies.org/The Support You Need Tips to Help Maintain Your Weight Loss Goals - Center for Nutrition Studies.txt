We are each other’s trigger for healthy and unhealthy habits. Suddenly, movie night becomes an excuse for potato chips, red wine, and chocolate. So, what do I do to minimize the possibility of a potato chip binge? Here are a few of my tools:Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies. All rights reserved.
