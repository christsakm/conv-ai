Core Conditioning â€” Why We Need It and What Really Works - Center for Nutrition Studies Collectively, the core muscles provide stability and support to all the other muscle groups and joints of the body. Strengthening the core provides a strong foundation, offering improved posture and protection from the most common causes of low back pain.While a strong core is important, so is a balanced core. Balancing the core is often overlooked, but it is no less important. A balanced core is demonstrated by equal strength on both sides of the body. While performing core-strengthening exercises, if one side feels more difficult than the other or if  you notice less range of motion on one side, then a muscle imbalance is likely present, which can lead to pain or injury.Another important consideration in core conditioning is nutrition. Every time you eat, your body releases insulin . How much insulin is released depends on what foods you are eating. A whole food, plant-based (WFPB) diet will generate a normal insulin response, while processed foods, sugar , and white flour will produce an excessively high insulin response. It is these repeated high insulin spikes that can lead to belly fat and weight gain, both of which are associated with an increased risk for low back pain and other joint discomfort.Diaphragmatic BreathingTransversus Abdominis ActivationMultifidus ActivationClamshellPelvic Floor ActivationTaking the time to properly condition your core using exercises to strengthen and balance your muscles while eating a WFPB diet has the potential to pay off in a big way, with improved posture and protection from the most common causes of low back pain and other joint discomfort.Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
