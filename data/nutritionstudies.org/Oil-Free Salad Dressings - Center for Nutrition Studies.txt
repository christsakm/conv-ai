Oil-Free Salad Dressings - Center for Nutrition Studies People often say cheese is the hardest thing they had to give up when adopting a whole food, plant-based (WFPB) diet, but for me, it was oil. I had to be convinced that I could make food taste good without oil, and after much experimentation, I saw the light. The question then became, “How do you replace the oil?” Thankfully, there are many choices, and each has its pluses and minuses.I have several salad dressing recipes that vary in their ingredients depending on the season and my mood. Variety makes my health journey easier, and having a dressing that I like gets me to eat more of nature’s best foods—vegetables. Here are some of my favorite ways to replace oil in most traditional salad dressing recipes.From the upcoming cookbook Table For One , by Del SroufeI like this dressing on freshly steamed vegetables as much as I do on salad greens.
