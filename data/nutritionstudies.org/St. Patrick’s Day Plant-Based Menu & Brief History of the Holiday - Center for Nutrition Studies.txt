St. Patrick’s Day Plant-Based Menu & Brief History of the Holiday - Center for Nutrition Studies St. Patrick’s Day occurs every year on March 17th and is a long standing holiday to honor the patron saint of Ireland, St. Patrick. According to History.com, “What began as a religious feast day in the 17th century has evolved into a variety of festivals across the globe celebrating Irish culture with parades, special foods, music, dancing, and a whole lot of green.” [1] It truly has become a day to feast and drink. Traditional Irish dishes contain meat and dairy, yet also focus on roots and vegetables such as potatoes, cabbage, kale, carrots, and onions. Sweeter dishes may contain apples, oats, seeds, or berries.Scene at a St. Patrick’s Day parade in DublinThroughout Ireland’s history there have been food shortages, including the Great Famine of 1845. During these shortages Irish cuisine actually focused on vegetarian meals. [2]In present day Ireland there has been a shift towards healthful eating with 5-10% of the population following a vegetarian diet. [3] One of our Plant-Based Nutrition graduates, Emily Dreeling from Ireland, reflects on her childhood where her dad taught her that meat is best thing on the plate. After learning more about nutrition she says, “It will now be my turn to stop my dad in the throes of his Sunday dinner, and begin educating him as to why, with absolute certainty, meat is the last thing that should ever be on anyone’s plate.”There are a few ‘accidentally’ vegan traditional Irish recipes, but there are even more plant-based options being created by plant-based chefs. We compiled this plant-based St. Patrick’s Day menu so that you can feast on healthy and delicious Irish inspired dishes. In Ireland when you toast a drink at a meal you will hear the word “Sláinte!” It is a Gaelic term that literally means “Health!” Have a healthy and happy St. Patrick’s Day!Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
