Study Looks at Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) & Diet People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who eat a greater ratio of plant to animal protein live longer, according to a recent study [ 1 ] . CKD is largely a disease of unhealthy aging in America, like dementia, cataracts, and osteoporosis. And it is extremely common. About a third of all Americans over the age of 60 have chronic kidney disease. Unfortunately, most are not aware that their kidneys are failing.The recent study found that those with at least stage 3 (out of 5) chronic kidney disease who consumed more plant-based diets had a reduced risk of death. Those with the highest ratio of plant to animal protein intake compared to the lowest had a 33% reduced risk of dying over the next 8 and a half years.Those with stage 4 or stage 5 CKD may need to be mindful of their potassium intake, but this new study adds to a deep fund of knowledge that a plant-based, low-animal protein diet is good for the kidneys. Given how common is the problem of kidney disease, this is an important message for all Americans.Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies. All rights reserved.
