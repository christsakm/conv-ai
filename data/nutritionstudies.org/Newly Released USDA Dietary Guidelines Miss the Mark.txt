Newly Released USDA Dietary Guidelines Miss the Mark Last April, 2015, I wrote my thoughts on the USDA Dietary Guidelines advisory committee report that awaited the response from the USDA Secretary’s office—just released.My comments were published in a congressional blog and on this website.I was once a supporter of the USDA report, however I am now convinced that this has become nothing more than a political football. The record speaks for itself. The advisory committee must walk on eggshells and when they hint of something scientifically new, it makes little difference.It is only perpetuation of a defunct process!Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
