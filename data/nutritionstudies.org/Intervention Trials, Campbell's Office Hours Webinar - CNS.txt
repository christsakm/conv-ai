Intervention Trials, Campbell's Office Hours Webinar - CNS The following video is a highlight from our October 2014 Campbellâ€™s Office Hours Webinar provided for current and past students . Dr. Thomas M. Campbell reviews three large human intervention trials that have been used as evidence that diet is not likely to be related to breast cancer. Take a look under the hood, however, and see exactly what dietary changes were being studied, and what is still left to study. Dr. Campbell concludes that important hypotheses involving a whole-foods, plant-based diet have not been investigated and more research is necessary.Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
