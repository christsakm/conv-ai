The China Study and Breast Cancer - Office Hours Webinar The following video is a highlight from our October 2014 Campbellâ€™s Office Hours Webinar provided for current and past students . T. Colin Campbell, PhD, provides a background on breast cancer through reviewing the evidence of several studies, including The China Study , on the significance of breast cancer and diet.  Dr. Campbell concludes that none of these studies included a whole foods, plant-based diet and he stresses the importance of diet on breast cancer.  More research still needs to be done when it comes to dietary effects on breast cancer.Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies. All rights reserved.
