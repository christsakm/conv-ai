Vitamins and Supplements - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>It is often stated that the use of vitamin and mineral supplements is an important strategy for promoting and re-gaining health. Supplements of individual vitamins do not work for long term health and to argue that they do, diverts attention away from the truly important message of consuming whole, plant-based foods. These supplements may increase tissue levels and they may, in some circumstances, assist in attenuating early lesions and reactions thought to lead to long term outcomes. But this is not long term health, for which there is essentially no evidence, as now summarized in several published meta-analyses of a large number of clinical trials during the past 2-3 decades.</p>, <p>Moreover, I strongly disagree with the assertion that taking vitamin and mineral supplements represents “nutrition”. It does not. These supplements have been shown in a growing number of studies that increased disease risk may be an outcome– exactly the opposite of the intended result. I consider nutrient supplements to be nothing more than an extension of the drug industry–in earlier years, Hoffman-LaRoche controlled more than 60% of the early market on vitamin C, for example. These products are only being offered earlier than the conventional drugs in the course of disease development, although this distinction is becoming ever more blurred.</p>, <p>I do not subscribe to the view that medical practice can be best improved by the use of these supplements.</p>, <p>In contrast to many who support the use of supplements, I receive no funding from the drug industry, either personally or professionally.</p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
