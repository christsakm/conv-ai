T. Colin Campbell was happy to do the interview. He stated “for some reason, ever since The China Study was published, one of the common age/gender groups I hear from are 12-13 year old girls!”</p>, <p>We encourage the leaders of tomorrow to understand and “take a stand” on food, health and nutrition. We are hopeful for the sake of our future health and for the planet. </p>, <p>We apologize in advance that the audio and visual timing are not perfectly in synch, but trust that you will enjoy this meaningful 17 minute exchange between two seventh grade girls and a world renowned, Cornell emeritus professor (over seven decades their senior). </p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
