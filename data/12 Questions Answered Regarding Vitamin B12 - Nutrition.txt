I think we have a natural tendency to make sure we are getting enough of everything, and vitamin B12 is a legitimate concern for exclusively plant-based eaters, so it causes a fair amount of anxiety. </p>, <p>Because of this, I spent some time reviewing literature regarding B12 when I was writing my book <em><a href="http://www.thecampbellplan.com" title="The Campbell Plan">The Campbell Plan</a></em>, in which I discuss B12, other supplements, and many other hot topics as people transition to a plant-based diet.

This is my interpretation of the evidence for general knowledge and should not be taken as medical advice. There are many clinical scenarios that might alter the advice below.
