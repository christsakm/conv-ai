105 lbs Down & I Feel the Best in My Entire Life My Plant-Based Journey to Ultimate Health - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>It’s a common refrain: I was eating healthy but then I slipped back into old habits. But this time, I want to help encourage you to KEEP GOING. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/696585124163421/?ref=gs&amp;fref=gs&amp;dti=203444036495296&amp;hc_location=group" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WFPB Family Healthy Food and Daily Inspirations</a> is a page I have started to share recipes, inspiration, and success stories. </p>, <p>Hopefully my story will inspire you or someone you love to make lasting changes toward health and wellness.</p>, <p>I yo-yo dieted for many years and seemed to have amazing results when I ate well and exercised, but then I would completely fall off the wagon and go further in the wrong direction. Sound familiar? Eventually I weighed over 310 lbs.</p>, <p>I am a married father of five beautiful, athletic daughters who are all under 12-years-old. My wife and I are both entrepreneurs and have a few successful businesses, and we are both on several paid and volunteer boards; giving back to the communities we live and work in is very important to us.</p>, <p>Between 30+ cheerleading and volleyball practices or games a week plus the several meetings daily we have in between, to say we are busy would be an understatement. As a result, my health unfortunately took a back seat. </p>, <p>After a health scare on May 13, 2019, I made a decision to take my health back! I had been slowly killing myself eating the Standard American Diet (SAD) and drinking alcohol moderately. I switched to a whole food, plant-based (WFPB) diet and haven’t looked back. I started at over 310 lbs and lost ‪100 lbs in 231 days‬, and I have NEVER felt this good or had this much energy in my entire life.</p>, <p>I am still losing weight and feeling great.️ The key is I finally made my health and wellness one of my top priorities. </p>, <p>I started my WFPB journey with juicing. After about a month, I added in a salad each night. </p>, <p>Now I have huge smoothies in the morning, power bowls for lunch and dinner, and healthy snacks (fruits, veggies, nuts, and seeds) whenever I want throughout the day. I have not counted a single calorie and I am rarely stepping on the scale. I am working out (playing squash, doing HIIT training, and weightlifting) at least an hour a day. I have also quit drinking alcohol, which was only filled with empty calories and regret.</p>, <p>I have a long road ahead, but I have fully embraced this lifestyle. The information I have been able to get at my fingertips has been phenomenal thanks to the many wonderful platforms and books available to us all. I can’t say enough good things about Food Matters TV, <em>Forks Over Knives</em>, Dr. T. Colin Campbell (<a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/the-china-study/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The China Study</em></a> and more), <em>The Game Changers, Hungry for Change</em>, and many more. I have also started a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/696585124163421/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> to share my journey to health. It has daily inspirations and recipes I have found that work for us and some we have personally created. </p>, <p>One of the biggest struggles has been the planning and prepping of meals each week while keeping things interesting and fresh. We have found that a little preparation can go a long way. For example, we absolutely love power bowls, and we can easily customize them throughout the week, helping us add variety to our diet.</p>, <p>What else? Well, my blood pressure is perfect, my bloodwork is amazing, I’m on ZERO prescriptions, my doctor is amazed at the changes, and I feel INCREDIBLE. I now have the energy I need for us to raise our daughters and still have energy and spark to keep the marriage strong. I am also proud to say I am being an active parent and am leading by example. </p>, <p>I hope that reading about my journey has inspired you and that you take the leap to explore a WFPB lifestyle. I promise you that you have nothing to lose, except the weight.</p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies. All rights reserved. </small></p>]
