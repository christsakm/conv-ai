After Eating Plant-Based Daniel Said Goodbye to 160 lbs, Sleep Apnea, & Type 2 Diabetes - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>It was tough growing up as a heavy kid. Picture this: an 8-year-old boy unable to play on the same team as his friends because he’s too heavy for his age group. Instead, he’s asked to play with the 10-year-old team because the weight requirement is higher. Growing up, I was teased and bullied due to my weight. And over time, I turned into an overweight teen, adult, husband, and father. I felt stuck in this fat body and destined to breathe heavily and be made fun of for life. Fast forward to December 2017, when I was debating stomach surgery and had a consultation with a bariatric surgeon. My fingers were numb and I was wearing 3XL shirts and size 46 pants. I was also diagnosed with <a href="https://www.pcrm.org/health-topics/diabetes" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">type 2 diabetes</a> at that time. That’s when my mom introduced me to <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/author/nbarnard/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Neal Barnard</a> and his plant-based diet, and how it has helped type 2 diabetics. I began studying his teachings and started following his blog to learn more. But it was about three months later, in March 2018, when I had a near diabetic coma episode with blood sugar in the 500s when I finally made up my mind that I could do this.</p>, <p>At first, I just Googled recipes endlessly. Then I joined all the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/203444036495296" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">plant-based Facebook groups</a> I could find and quietly observed others and their successes. I started a fitness program and changed it. I kept trying new programs and gyms. Today, I’m training for my first triathlon. I’m down over 160 pounds, reversed type 2 diabetes and sleep apnea, and am working on my own plant-based meal prep/catering business.  </p>, <p><img alt="Eating Plant-Based Success Story" src="https://cdn.nutritionstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/after-eating-plant-based-daniel-said-goodbye-to-160-lbs-sleep-apnea-type-2-diabetes-1.jpg"/></p>, <p>For whole food, plant-based weight loss support, visit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/753008028757433" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Chef Del’s Diet Daze Facebook Group</a>. </p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
