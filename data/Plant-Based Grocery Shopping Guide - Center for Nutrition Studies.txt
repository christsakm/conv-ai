Plant-Based Grocery Shopping Guide - Center for Nutrition Studies [<p>Plant-Based Shopping is actually easier than you think! This list is intended as a resource to help you get started. Keep in mind that food product formulations do change, so it is wise to read labels. These products are not endorsed by the T. Colin Campbell Center for Nutrition Studies.</p>, <p><strong>Fresh Produce (Fruits and Vegetables)</strong><br>
Enjoy a wide variety of fruits and vegetables! Choose plenty of dark leafy greens. </br></p>, <p><strong>Beans and Legumes</strong><br/>
Enjoy ALL varieties of dried beans and lentils. If you buy canned beans, look for low-sodium or no-salt. If you can’t get no-salt added, rinse the beans well with water prior to use.</p>, <p><strong>Nuts, Seeds, and Dried Fruits</strong><br/>
If you do choose to purchase nuts, any variety is ok but look for raw and no oil-added. Avoid eating by the handful as they are high fat and high calorie and very easy to overeat. Use nut butters sparingly.  </p>, <p>Omega-3 rich chia and flax seeds can used to top cereal and replace eggs in baked goods (1 tbsp chia or ground flaxseed plus 3 tbsp water = 1 “egg”). Whole flax seeds are not digested so it is best to buy ground flax seeds or even better, grind them right before use in a coffee grinder. Use other seeds (sesame, pumpkin, sunflower) sparingly.</p>, <p>Most dried fruits are acceptable when they are eaten sparingly and do not have added sugar. Keep in mind they are higher in calories than fresh fruits. If you are diabetic or trying to lose weight, eat fresh fruits rather than dried fruits.
