A W holistic Approach to Health & Healing - Nutrition Studies [<p>Having lost my mom to cancer at the early age of 54, as well as losing twin girls, my job and my marriage, I suddenly woke up to the fact that I needed to find a different approach to life. I had hit rock bottom, and I needed to dig my way back out. I needed solutions—and fast.</p>, <p>I knew I was stressed out and that it was putting my health at risk. I was also aware that my own genetic history was abysmal. If I wanted to protect myself and my loved ones from disease and illness, I needed to find alternative answers. It was now or never.</p>, <p>My new book, <em>Get Balanced, Get Blissed</em>,  explores a personal journey of finding and implementing a “w”holistic approach to health and healing. Focusing on the five components of well-being—body, mind, environment, relationships and spirit—was vital in restoring my life to balance and bliss.</p>, <p>In studying plant-based nutrition through the T. Colin Campbell Foundation, I learned that having a genetic predisposition to a disease does not necessarily mean that there will be genetic expression of it. Understanding the body’s ability to ward off disease was empowering and provided a framework for the solution I was seeking. However, that was only part of the answer. I was still stressed and unhappy, and the rest of my life needed sorting out.</p>, <p>Our minds are inextricably tied to the health of our bodies. Learning how to calm myself, manage stress and pick myself up when I needed it most was another part of the solution. As I learned how to meditate (and later go on to study and teach it), my body felt more relaxed, I was able to make better decisions, I was more emotionally balanced and much more in touch with my authentic self.</p>, <p>After a lifetime of doing the “right” thing—or at least what I thought had been right—I learned how to do the right thing for myself. I realized that we are not alone on this journey. Our health and well-being are connected to the relationships we make and the environment we live in. Through nurturing my home environment, my physical environment and my interpersonal connections, I enriched and empowered myself. I am so grateful to the T. Colin Campbell Foundation for helping me to take charge of my health and my life. <em>Get Balanced, Get Blissed</em> wouldn’t have been possible without the Foundation’s work.</p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies.
