  Decades ago, when I was still studying biophysics at Cornell’s Agriculture School, I reached out to Professor Gertrude Buehring about her landmark findings that a cancer-causing virus was infecting the U.S. meat and dairy supply. What could I do to help warn the public about the potential threat? To my surprise, she pleaded with me to keep quiet. She still had to prove people were being infected by the virus and she had yet to demonstrate a link to human cancers. If word got out prematurely, she was afraid the meat and dairy industries would threaten her funding and shut down her work. So I kept quiet… until now.
