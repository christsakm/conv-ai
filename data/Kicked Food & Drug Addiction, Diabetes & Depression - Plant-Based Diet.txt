Kicked Food & Drug Addiction, Diabetes & Depression - Plant-Based Diet [<p>My name is Adam Sud. A little over 3 ½ years ago I weighed 310 lbs. I was an undiagnosed type 2 diabetic and had undiagnosed high blood pressure. I was a drug addict, a fast food addict, and suffering from severe depression. At this point my life consisted of sitting in my filthy apartment, surrounded by fast food trash while either on massive amounts of Adderall or eating processed fast food. I was miserable all the time and blamed everyone and everything else for my situation in life. I was constantly self-conscious about my weight and I was never comfortable in any social situation without being on my drug. I was barely working and running out of money. I knew that I was heading towards the day when I would be living on the street and the reality was that day was very close. I had literally spent every cent I had on drugs and drug fueled compulsive shopping. I had hit my rock bottom. I finally picked up the phone and called my father for help. Two weeks later I checked into rehab.</p>, <p>It was during my first 24 hours in rehab that I was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic with high blood pressure. I was put on seven prescription medications, diabetes meds, blood pressure meds, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, ADHD meds, and sleeping meds. I remember feeling utterly disgusted with myself because I knew that I had done this myself. This was entirely my fault and for the first time I had to take responsibility for my lifestyle. But I had an amazing realization, if I am the problem, then I get to be the solution. These were lifestyle diseases that are completely reversible through lifestyle changes. I took it upon myself to reverse my type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure by implementing a plant-based nutrition plan into my recovery program of medication and therapy. What I didn’t realize was that plant-based nutrition would become the backbone of my entire recovery. </p>, <p>Now, I was a 7<sup>th</sup> generation Texan who was addicted to fast food. This was no easy switch. I read a book by Dr. Doug Lisle called <em>The Pleasure Trap: Mastering the Hidden Force that Undermines Health &amp; Happiness</em>. What I learned from this book was ultimately in order to successfully change my life I had to be comfortable being uncomfortable. That has become my motto for my entire recovery. “Becoming comfortable with being uncomfortable is the key to lifestyle change and recovery.” Within 4 months I completely reversed my type 2 diabetes and blood pressure, in 10 months I lost 100 lbs, and within one year I was off of all seven medications I was prescribed in rehab. Today I am over 3 ½ years sober and weigh 165 lbs. I realized that plant-based nutrition has an amazing power in regards to addiction recovery. I became a certified holistic lifestyle coach and developed a program using nutrition as a tool for addiction recovery and relapse prevention. I now run groups at sober-living houses and Intensive Outpatient Therapy centers in LA.  I am honored to speak at events such as Rip Esselstyn’s Engine 2 plant-based immersions, Plant-Stock, Rich Roll podcasts, and much more.</p>, <p>People always ask me about what I’ve lost and I enjoy telling them about the 140 lbs, the diseases (type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, depression), and the seven medications. But what I enjoy more than all of that is what I have gained. Early morning runs on the lake with my dad, a real relationship with him and the rest of my family, my self worth and self-confidence, my purpose in life, the ability to help others, and most importantly, my twin brother Bobby. He has moved into my place in LA to start his own plant strong journey. In 3 1/2 months he lost 50 lbs, was taken off of his type 2 diabetes meds in a week, and dropped his blood pressure from 140/100 to 120/80 in three weeks.</p>, <p>Today, I can honestly say that I am the happiest and the healthiest I have ever been in my life. Plant-based nutrition didn’t just save my life, it has given me the ability to create an entirely new one. It’s one that I look forward to living every single day.</p>, <p class="d-none d-print-block mt-3 mb-0"><small> Copyright 2022 Center for Nutrition Studies. All rights reserved. </small></p>]
