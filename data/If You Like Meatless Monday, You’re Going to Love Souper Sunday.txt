If You Like Meatless Monday, You’re Going to Love Souper Sunday [<p>No doubt you’ve heard of Meatless Monday, even Taco Tuesday for that matter. But come to my house any Sunday from fall to spring, and you’ll find another celebration:  Souper Sunday. Soup, in other words, is the star of this show, and it’s become a coveted tradition for me and my husband, even friends and family when they get the invite. </p>, <p>Soup as a meal? It’s a question I’ve jokingly debated with folks throughout the years, some say ‘No way,’ no matter what the soup. Of course, I disagree, but that’s not to say that at times, I don’t add a sidekick or two to the soup. </p>, <p>My plant-based palate tends to prefer soups with at least one type of bean, if not more, so much that my husband wonders how many more bean soup recipes there could possibly be in this world. If I’m serving a lower-calorie or less-filling soup, I’ll pair it with a salad and often, a crusty piece of bread.  </p>, <p>What I love about this tradition isn’t so much that soup warms you from the inside, something those of us in winter climates certainly appreciate, but it is a great way to up the ante of veggies, legumes, even whole grains, herbs and spices in your diet.</p>, <p>Want to start your own Souper Sunday tradition?
